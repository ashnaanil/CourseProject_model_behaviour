""In 1960, University of Illinois professor Leo Koch wrote a public letter condoning per-marital sex. He was fired. Four years later, a professor named Revilo Oliver made white supremacist remarks and claimed there was a massive communist conspiracy. He kept his job. 
Matthew C. Ehrlich revisits the Koch and Oliver cases to look at free speech, the legacy of the 1960s (in Champaign County), and debates over sex and politics on campus. The different treatment of the two men marked a fundamental shift in the understanding of academic freedom. Their cases also embodied the stark divide over beliefs and values-a divide that remains today. Ehrlich delves into the issues behind two academic controversies and places events in the context of a time rarely associated with dissent, but in fact a harbinger of the social and political upheavals to come""

There are many different variations of this revered 500-year-old art form. Traditionally, guests sit in the seiza posture on the tatami mats (kneeling with legs folded underneath and resting on the heels). There is also a variety of tea ceremony in which one sits on a chair while drinking the tea called Ry?rei style, or table-style tea ceremony.
Historically in Japan, people didn't use chairs. They sat on the floor for most everything, even to eat meals. The Ry?rei style of tea ceremony was created by Gengensai Seich? (1810-1877), the 11th head of the Urasenke school of tea ceremony, for an exposition held in 1872 in Kyoto. Many foreigners visited Japan at this time, so the government requested that an effort be made to modify the traditional form of tea ceremony as a way of making it more accessible.
The main feature of Ry?rei style is that both host and guests sit on a chair. The seiza posture is no longer used, but utensils are used in the same way as in a normal tea ceremony. Although this one aspect of the ceremony is altered, the Ry?rei style is otherwise the same as a tea ceremony performed using the seiza posture. Even Japanese people, who use the seiza posture much less than in the past, embrace the Ry?rei style of tea ceremony because it places less of a burden on the legs.
We will be alternating weekly between Ry?rei, (sitting on chairs), and sitting traditionally on tatami mats.

What To Expect
After a brief tour that includes history of Japan House on the campus of the University of Illinois and information on the tea ceremony, watch as the host carefully and thoughtfully prepares each piece of equipment, chosen specifically for that day and season. Each guest will be served wagashi, a traditional seasonal Japanese sweet, and matcha tea in a unique handmade chawan, or tea bowl. Experience a moment of peace.
Afterward, there will be time for guests to ask questions, as well as to shop from a wall of unique Japanese-inspired treasures that are part of our annual Bazaar sale. Cash and credit cards accepted.
Tea ceremonies will feature a variety of special handmade sweets, or wagashi, using recipes from the cookbook ""The Art of Wagashi: Recipes for Japanese Sweets that Delight the Palate and the Eyes"" written by Japan House Professor Emeritus Kimiko Gunji. The cookbook will be available for purchase.
Reservations are required, no walk-in’s will be allowed. Space is limited to 15.
All guests will be asked to remove shoes upon entering, and to wear fresh, white socks (we have some to lend you if you forget). We ask that legs be covered as is traditional in Japan. 
Out of respect for both the tea students and the other guests, we kindly ask that everyone wear a mask while not eating or drinking.

T?HE SLAPS
At its core, Tomato Tree by The Slaps is an exercise in patience that seamlessly showcases the virtues of experimentation. Composed of guitarist/vocalist Rand Kelly, bassist/vocalist Ramsey Bell, and percussionist/vocalist Josh Resing, the band’s latest collection of songs is an achievement – a document of deepening friendship and their collective and personal advancements in artistic maturity. 
Though the band formed out of a chance meeting at a party in 2016 during their first year of college at DePaul University, The Slaps are bound together by a spirit of pastoral music making – the notion that collaboratively using the available resources can produce stunning results. 
“It’s been about trust – it starts with each other. We trust each other so much. We trust each other to live in different places and keep this thing going,” says Resing, referencing Bell and Kelly’s recent move from Chicago back to their homes in Lexington, Kentucky. “You can’t do that with just anybody.”
Despite Tomato Tree sounding effortless, the record was pieced together meticulously from June 2020 to April 2021 at Pallet Sound in Chicago with assistance from engineer Michael MacDonald. Certain tracks (like the bright-but-distorted instrumental “Fire on Fire”) were finessed during marathon rehearsal sessions whereby a song was played for nearly five hours straight before committing the tracks to record. 
From their inception, many of the songs on Tomato Tree (such as “Around,” “Powder,” “It’s Dense,” and “Iron Bone”) took between two and four years to produce, undergoing significant changes while being rehearsed and performed in clubs around Chicago where the band developed their following. “We’ve never put any pressure at all on ourselves to finish a song,” says Bell of the process behind Tomato Tree. 
Through several years of writing and arranging, the band stresses that being patient allowed the songs to manifest in ways they wouldn’t if the process were rushed. “A lot of what contributed to timing and what it took to complete the album was unintentional – it was a matter of individual and personal circumstance,” says Kelly as he references the pandemic, a move across the country to Washington, and other factors that contributed to the length of time taken to produce the record. This reliance on grappling with context allowed the band to hone in on their ability to execute the songs in concert, which has proven to bring new fans into the fold whenever the band tours. 
This emphasis on performance – on the unmediated expression of music from artist to audience in a live setting – has been, and always will be, a central component of The Slaps’ ethos. It’s perhaps no surprise that the lyrics for album’s opener, “Anything For Now,” meditates on mosh pits and music venues. “The trust component is in the live show, too. We’re comfortable going into the unknown on stage with one another,” says Resing. “It’s exciting to us – not scary,” he adds. 
While certainly a more fully-realized record than their previous affairs, Tomato Tree does contain sequels of sorts to previously-released material while also pointing toward new directions that The Slaps promise to explore later. “Around” is the completion of a trilogy, a bookend to the previously released songs “Will Have Been Being Around” from 2017’s Susan’s Room and “Being Around” from 2019’s A. Those songs comprise a three-part reflection on love, an arc that, according to Resing, moves from “specific, personal” moments of heartbreak to “something more universal and general” found on “Around.”
Tomato Tree’s short-but-sprawling closing track “Somber Slumber” is, to put it in the words of the band, “a work in progress” – at least in the sense that there’s already been a Part II for the song written that will soon be recorded for Tomato Tree’s follow-up. Other offerings, like the synth-laden “Hell No” and the instrumental “Autotelic” found midway through the album, index the band’s ability to creatively bring programmed sounds into the fold, blending Bell and Resing’s interest in electronic music with The Slaps’ typical organic soundscapes.
This spirit of collaboration and refinement found throughout Tomato Tree extends beyond the three members of the band. The first voice on the record is that of Lunar Vacation’s Maggie Geeslin (who Resing calls “a light in a dark world”) and “Anything For Now” also includes “audio donations” from the band’s fans and family gathered during the early months of the pandemic. Originally intended to soften the pangs of loneliness created by social distancing, these recordings became an outlet for The Slaps to fuse their interest in sampling with their latest project.
“With the live set, we’re always trying to break down this barrier of the audience thinking that we’re performing for them,” says Bell of the band’s irreverence toward artists being placed on a pedestal above their audiences. “We want to bring them into the album and into our performances as much as possible.”
Although The Slaps have a discography that predates Tomato Tree, the band insists that their latest offering is their first proper full-length album. “This is the most time we’ve spent on produced music,” says Kelly of the completed product that is the record. “This is what we wanted,” adds Resing. “I feel like we did exactly what we set out to do.”
F?RIKO
Fans know Friko (Bailey Minzenberger, Luke Stamos, and frontman Niko Kapetan) as vital rising stars in the Chicago scene. The music, which freelancer Britt Julious described as “perfect slices of indie-pop” in the Chicago Tribune last January, is complex, layered, and dynamic. Over the band's time together, it has become clear they are comfortable embracing multiple musical extremes at once. Take a listen to the explosive and hypnotic beat of ""In_Out"" off their self managed 2022 EP release, Whenever Forever, and juxtapose it against the serene, strings soaked tracks that follow, ""Half as Far"" and ""Can I See U Again."" It becomes even more pronounced in live performance, where a frenzied floor, grinding with wailing guitars and animation, in the very next minutes finds itself collectively holding its breath silently as the band eases them into a spell. Lyrically, Kapetan explores the possibility and risks of a life given over to music, interrogating what a life well-lived means to him. The duality rings out in the compositions, evoking rock and folk icons such as Leonard Cohen and Nick Drake. As Friko plays out sweeping melodies, held up by thrashing guitar and punchy beats, it feels as if Kapetan sings to you. Crooning about stories you know, memories you had but have somehow forgotten.
The band is planning tour dates, and is near completion of what is to become the core of a new full length album.

Trace monoprints have a recognizable grainy appearance which can be seen in Paul Klee’s monoprints from the ‘20s and some of Gaugin's portraits. The process is quick, so you will have time to create more than one print during the workshop. Lisa will also demonstrate ways to enhance your print with watercolor, collage, etc. Scroll down to see more samples. 
This course is perfect for beginners, educators, and artists who would like to experiment with a new technique. All supplies will be provided. No previous experience necessary. Ages 14 and up welcome.

While the ScrumMaster helps the Scrum Team work together to learn and implement Scrum, as a CSPO, you create the product vision, order the Product Backlog, and make sure the best possible job is done to delight the customer.

This CSPO certification training will help you learn how to improve product value by speeding the delivery of product features, lead scrum teams, effectively communicate what you want your product to do, and maximize project ROI. It is the ideal course package for every aspiring professional who wants to pursue a career in project management

CSPO certification course is designed for professionals placed at the critical position of product owners; a place from where they contribute to the high-performing scrum teams. The course is delivered by a certified Scrum trainer having extensive professional experience and aims at delivering real-life competencies.

The CSPO is a high-end certification that explores the competencies required for being a Product owner, working with Product assumptions and backlogs along with supplementing the understanding of customers and users. With the CSPO certification, you would be able to:




The median salary of a CSPO professional is $105,000 a year, according to recent surveys by payscale.com. The demand for CSPO professionals continues to increase and Fortune 500 companies are continually hiring CSPO professionals.
There are no set eligibility requirements for the CSPO certification. Any professional interested in attaining Scrum certification may attend the CSPO training course.
As defined by the Scrum Alliance, a Certified Scrum Product Owner (CSPO) is someone who has been taught by a Certified Scrum Trainer about the Scrum terminology, practices, and principles that will enable them to fulfil the role of Scrum Product Owner.
Taking a CSPO course is a first step on the path to becoming a product owner. 
Experience and continuing education are necessary for someone to become a product owner.

On successful completion of a training, two days (16 hours) CSPO course taught by a Certified Scrum Trainer (such as this course), you will receive a Certificate from Scrum Alliance designating you as Certified Scrum Product Owner. The certification includes a two-year membership in Scrum Alliance.

Observe a free trial to see if it's right for you. Based out of New York City for 30 years, we are now offering these classes online to an international audience. 
This one free trial class is an observation session to see if the $425/10 session program is right for you. The instructor will be happy to answer any questions following the session.

****30 Years of Testimonials: https://www.speakeeezi.com/success.htm
Once the 10 session package is purchased, the student may use their sessions however they choose.  The course is ongoing, so each session has participants at all levels. We use a workbook which each student works through at their own pace.
This is the 30th year we’ve been helping people turn their dread into confidence. Gradual exposure allows you to face fear in manageable steps, at your own pace, in a supportive environment. Instructors Charles di Cagno and Kyra Smith, are phobia therapists, and former and current Directors of Public Speaking at White Plains Hospital Anxiety Treatment Center in the United States. 
Whatever the level of public speaking, we can help you improve. For those with anxiety, we provide gradual exposure to public speaking through a step ladder of basic to more advanced exercises. For the more experienced, it's a platform tailored to your specific needs to improve various delivery techniques. It is self-paced, in a low pressure, supportive environment with lots of feedback to address your specific issues. Begin with basic exercises and move forward only when ready. 
The course is ongoing, with a mix of beginning and advanced students. Our hope is you are inspired, not intimidated by the dynamic speakers present, and keep in mind they started with the same fears, progressing to their present level by consistent effort. The course is not difficult. If you have the will, we offer the way to turn a liability into your most powerful asset. The real challenge is admitting you need guidance, getting started, and making a committed, consistent effort.
Our 100% success rate over 20 years for wedding speeches is just one indication of our effectiveness. But, whatever the challenge, (formal presentation, group discussion, business meeting, sales, confrontation, employment interview) the program is customized to fit your needs.
Sample Gradual Exposure Program Outline for Public Speaking Anxiety:
Session One - Get comfortable hearing your voice in public by responding to very simple questions while seated. The questions (i.e., name, occupation, where you live, etc.) require little thought or content.
Session Two - Learning to stand confidently before a group. You will stand, with several others and respond to simple questions. As your confidence increases, one by one, each person standing will sit, until you are standing alone. You will continue until this begins to feel comfortable.
Session Three- This exercise is the same as the previous one except you start by standing alone.
Session Four - Gestures and Movement. Enhance your message, decrease tension and project a confident demeanor incorporating non-verbal skills.
Session Five - Implement the skills learned in the session four by relating a personal experience using gestures and movement to enhance your narrative.
Session Six - Respond to Questions. Open the floor to questions on a topic of choice.
Session Seven - Impromptu Speaking. Learn to organize and deliver an unprepared (no notes) talk.
Session Eight - Prepared Speech (Instructor Guided). Learn the secret of outlining and presenting a prepared speech with minimal effort or stress.
Session Nine - Prepared Speech. Outline and deliver a speech unassisted.
Once you have mastered the above you can begin simulating all manner of interpersonal and public communication including:
Persuasive Speaking
Panel Discussion
Conflict Resolution
Defending your Position
Debating
Initiating and Sustaining Conversation
As well as many others
We look forward to working with you.

In this Two-day workshop-style course, attendees gain the practical tools and techniques necessary to implement the Lean Portfolio Management functions of Strategy and Investment Funding, Agile Portfolio Operations, and Lean Governance.

Participants in the course have the opportunity to capture the current and the future state of their portfolio with the Portfolio Canvas tool and identify important business initiatives for achieving the future state. Participants also explore methods to establish portfolio flow with the Portfolio Kanban and prioritize initiatives for maximum economic benefit. The course also provides insights on how to establish Value Stream Budgets and Lean Budget Guardrails and measure the Lean portfolio performance.



Why Lean Portfolio Management?

Organizations that focus on defining projects that span more than a year often get stuck in situations where teams are incentivized to meet out-of-date project goals, instead of delivering value early or seeking early feedback on market-fit. Lean portfolio management methods help organizations:



?	Shift the operations focus to delivering incremental value at shorter cadences for larger initiatives.

?	Leverage the cadences to achieve shorter feedback loops. Feedback collected via internal teams, external focus groups, customers, or end users helps measure progress towards the organization’s target outcomes.

?	Ruthlessly apply the feedback to reinvest in ideas that produce good outcomes and downshift on ideas that do not. Produce good outcomes and downshift on ideas that do not.



Lean Portfolio Management, informed by lean principles and built through a better understanding of customer value (and how to deliver it quickly), remedies some common pain points in large organizations.



Topics Covered



•	Introducing Lean Portfolio Management (LPM).



•	.Establishing Strategy and Investment Funding.



•	Applying Agile Portfolio Operations.



•	Applying Lean Governance Implementing the LPM function.

In this Two-day workshop-style course, attendees gain the practical tools and techniques necessary to implement the Lean Portfolio Management functions of Strategy and Investment Funding, Agile Portfolio Operations, and Lean Governance.

Participants in the course have the opportunity to capture the current and the future state of their portfolio with the Portfolio Canvas tool and identify important business initiatives for achieving the future state. Participants also explore methods to establish portfolio flow with the Portfolio Kanban and prioritize initiatives for maximum economic benefit. The course also provides insights on how to establish Value Stream Budgets and Lean Budget Guardrails and measure the Lean portfolio performance.



Why Lean Portfolio Management?

Organizations that focus on defining projects that span more than a year often get stuck in situations where teams are incentivized to meet out-of-date project goals, instead of delivering value early or seeking early feedback on market-fit. Lean portfolio management methods help organizations:



?	Shift the operations focus to delivering incremental value at shorter cadences for larger initiatives.

?	Leverage the cadences to achieve shorter feedback loops. Feedback collected via internal teams, external focus groups, customers, or end users helps measure progress towards the organization’s target outcomes.

?	Ruthlessly apply the feedback to reinvest in ideas that produce good outcomes and downshift on ideas that do not. Produce good outcomes and downshift on ideas that do not.



Lean Portfolio Management, informed by lean principles and built through a better understanding of customer value (and how to deliver it quickly), remedies some common pain points in large organizations.



Topics Covered



•	Introducing Lean Portfolio Management (LPM).



•	.Establishing Strategy and Investment Funding.



•	Applying Agile Portfolio Operations.

The success of Agile depends on solid teams and every team member needs to be well versed with its concepts and tools. Increasing demand for Agile professionals has made Agile & Scrum courses very popular.
Scrum is an agile framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products, with an initial emphasis on software development, although it has been used in other fields including research, sales, marketing and advanced technologies. It is designed for teams of ten or fewer members, who break their work into goals that can be completed within time-boxed iterations, called sprints, no longer than one month and most commonly two weeks. The Scrum Team track progress in 15-minute time-boxed daily meetings, called daily scrums. At the end of the sprint, the team holds sprint review, to demonstrate the work done, and sprint retrospective to improve continuously.
Instil Learning’s Agile and Scrum training with its focus on Agile development and Scrum practices will teach you to harness complex processes and apply Scrum techniques for project success. With hands-on practice sessions and a comprehensive theory, you will be ready to initiate the Agile transformation in your project and your organization.

This is accomplished through the use of two Six Sigma sub-methodologies: DMAIC and DMADV. The Six Sigma DMAIC process (define, measure, analyze, improve, control) is an improvement system for existing processes falling below specification and looking for incremental improvement. The Six Sigma DMADV process (define, measure, analyze, design, verify) is an improvement system used to develop new processes or products at Six Sigma quality levels. It can also be employed if a current process requires more than just incremental improvement. Both Six Sigma processes are executed by Six Sigma Green Belts and Six Sigma Black Belts, and are overseen by Six Sigma Master Black Belts.

Black Belts save companies approximately $230,000 per project and can complete four to 6 projects per year. GE first began Six Sigma in 1995 after Motorola and Allied Signal blazed the Six Sigma trail. Since then, thousands of companies around the world have discovered the far reaching benefits of Six Sigma.

COLLEGE, MARINES, CORPORATE, COMEDY

A favorite on the nationally syndicated Bob and Tom Radio Show, Greg has also appeared on Late Night with Conan O’Brien, Comedy Central, CBS, ABC, FOX, MTV and CMT.



Greg Hahn has parlayed his absurdly energetic, all out style of physical humor, one liners and crowd work into a performance of immediate pandemonium and continuous laughs. His unique stylings have led to numerous television, corporate and theater appearances throughout the US and Canada.



Greg was raised in South Florida where in high school he amused the Catholic nuns by poking holes in his pockets enabling pencils to shoot out of his pant leg.



As a college basketball player, his enjoyment of half court shots earned him a sweet spot on the bench.



As a Captain in the Marines Corps, Greg kept his men highly motivated and could not overemphasize that camouflage is continuous.



While a buyer for Lockheed Corporation, he thought “Why make $200 a day, when I can be a comedian and make that in a week?”



After several serious jobs where he refused to be serious, Greg turned pro as a stand up comedian and landed a job as emcee for a theme park lumberjack show. This supplied him with four audiences a day, intoxicated ax swinging lumberjacks, and a log rolling dog.



Soon afterwards, he worked as stuntman in the Wild Wild Wild West Stunt Show at Universal Studios. “For $20 an hour, I’d run out and get hit in the head with a stick, perfect!”



He continually honed his style of comedy then headed to New York City. While in New York, Greg developed into a touring headliner and costarred in the independent film Tomorrow Night which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. Then, after successful shows at the Montreal and Chicago Comedy Festivals, Greg enjoyed television appearances on Late Night with Conan O’Brien (NBC), Premium Blend (Comedy Central), Make Me Laugh (5 episodes, Comedy Central), Louis CK’s Pulp Comics (Comedy Central), 30 Seconds to Fame (Fox), Cedric the Entertainer Presents (Fox) and Star Search (CBS).
When appearing on Star Search, Greg was spotted by Tom Griswold of the nationally syndicated Bob & Tom Radio Show. Greg has since established himself as a favorite guest on the show and starred on the Bob @ Tom Comedy Central Special. He also headlines the Friends of The Bob @ Tom Theater Tour, which included a stop at the Las Vegas Comedy Festival.



A return appearance to the Montreal Comedy Festival along with the Halifax Comedy Festival and wild appearances on Country Music Television’s “Comedy Stage”, “Comics Unleashed with Byron Allen” and running for president on “TOSH.O” (Comedy Central) have added to Greg’s popularity.



Greg now lives in Los Angeles where he continues to infiltrate the TV and movie biz with the intention of buying a llama farm and a kitchen fish tank.

And his light swagger, playful squint, and wry smile tell you that perhaps there’s more to this multi-layered joke than you first recognized.
Costaki began to make some noise in the business by reaching the finals of the Seattle Comedy Competition, where he was discovered and invited to the prestigious Montreal Comedy Festival. He’s been back to Montreal twice since then. And he was just one of ten finalists in Comedy Central’s Laugh Riots national talent search.
You may have seen him recently on a Showtime Special. Or on Comedy.TV, Last Comic Standing, or NickMom Night Out. Over the years, Costaki has performed in all 50 states, covering the country’s best clubs, hundreds of beautiful theaters, dozens of colleges, and some of the worst bars in America.
Also a talented writer, Costaki’s jokes have appeared on The Tonight Show, The Late Late Show, and Best Damn Sports Show Period. He was a writer for BET, where he was staffed on two of their hit shows. He wrote jokes for Bette Midler’s Kiss My Brass Tour. Costaki spent Spring Break one year in Cancun writing on the MTV show Parental Approval. He also wrote daily for The Complete Sheet, a DJ prep service that goes out to almost 500 stations worldwide.

COLLEGE, MARINES, CORPORATE, COMEDY
A favorite on the nationally syndicated Bob and Tom Radio Show, Greg has also appeared on Late Night with Conan O’Brien, Comedy Central, CBS, ABC, FOX, MTV and CMT.

Greg Hahn has parlayed his absurdly energetic, all out style of physical humor, one liners and crowd work into a performance of immediate pandemonium and continuous laughs. His unique stylings have led to numerous television, corporate and theater appearances throughout the US and Canada.

Greg was raised in South Florida where in high school he amused the Catholic nuns by poking holes in his pockets enabling pencils to shoot out of his pant leg.

As a college basketball player, his enjoyment of half court shots earned him a sweet spot on the bench.

As a Captain in the Marines Corps, Greg kept his men highly motivated and could not overemphasize that camouflage is continuous.

While a buyer for Lockheed Corporation, he thought “Why make $200 a day, when I can be a comedian and make that in a week?”

After several serious jobs where he refused to be serious, Greg turned pro as a stand up comedian and landed a job as emcee for a theme park lumberjack show. This supplied him with four audiences a day, intoxicated ax swinging lumberjacks, and a log rolling dog.

Soon afterwards, he worked as stuntman in the Wild Wild Wild West Stunt Show at Universal Studios. “For $20 an hour, I’d run out and get hit in the head with a stick, perfect!”

He continually honed his style of comedy then headed to New York City. While in New York, Greg developed into a touring headliner and costarred in the independent film Tomorrow Night which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. Then, after successful shows at the Montreal and Chicago Comedy Festivals, Greg enjoyed television appearances on Late Night with Conan O’Brien (NBC), Premium Blend (Comedy Central), Make Me Laugh (5 episodes, Comedy Central), Louis CK’s Pulp Comics (Comedy Central), 30 Seconds to Fame (Fox), Cedric the Entertainer Presents (Fox) and Star Search (CBS).
When appearing on Star Search, Greg was spotted by Tom Griswold of the nationally syndicated Bob & Tom Radio Show. Greg has since established himself as a favorite guest on the show and starred on the Bob @ Tom Comedy Central Special. He also headlines the Friends of The Bob @ Tom Theater Tour, which included a stop at the Las Vegas Comedy Festival.

A return appearance to the Montreal Comedy Festival along with the Halifax Comedy Festival and wild appearances on Country Music Television’s “Comedy Stage”, “Comics Unleashed with Byron Allen” and running for president on “TOSH.O” (Comedy Central) have added to Greg’s popularity.

Greg now lives in Los Angeles where he continues to infiltrate the TV and movie biz with the intention of buying a llama farm and a kitchen fish tank.

And his light swagger, playful squint, and wry smile tell you that perhaps there’s more to this multi-layered joke than you first recognized.
Costaki began to make some noise in the business by reaching the finals of the Seattle Comedy Competition, where he was discovered and invited to the prestigious Montreal Comedy Festival. He’s been back to Montreal twice since then. And he was just one of ten finalists in Comedy Central’s Laugh Riots national talent search.
You may have seen him recently on a Showtime Special. Or on Comedy.TV, Last Comic Standing, or NickMom Night Out. Over the years, Costaki has performed in all 50 states, covering the country’s best clubs, hundreds of beautiful theaters, dozens of colleges, and some of the worst bars in America.
Also a talented writer, Costaki’s jokes have appeared on The Tonight Show, The Late Late Show, and Best Damn Sports Show Period. He was a writer for BET, where he was staffed on two of their hit shows. He wrote jokes for Bette Midler’s Kiss My Brass Tour. Costaki spent Spring Break one year in Cancun writing on the MTV show Parental Approval. He also wrote daily for The Complete Sheet, a DJ prep service that goes out to almost 500 stations worldwide.
But he is easily best known for regular segment on the syndicated Bob & Tom Radio Show that reaches some five million people in 140 markets, including La Porte's Rock Station, Rock 106.5. And that segment has spun off into “Quick Snaps,” the all-NFL topical version, which has a weekly home during the season on Sirius XM Satellite Radio. “Quick Snaps” is also a podcast, and appears weekly on several independent radio shows all over the country. This national exposure has opened the door to Costaki’s dream: people coming to see his live performances “on purpose.”
Doors open at 8:45, show starts promptly at 9:15 pm-don't be late. 
Beer, Wine, Water, Soda, etc and snacks will be available for purchase. 
Tickets are 25.00 per person

The Chicago Scene New Year's Party at the Drake was one of the best I've ever been to. We spend New Year's in Miami, last year and it was the worst experience of my life. This year we decided to stay home and go to your party and had a great time. Great music, plenty of bars, great food, and a great crowd.
- Brian H. Lincoln Park, IL
I never send thank you letters but I just wanted to say thanks to my group of friends from the University of Wisconsin, Madison and the University of Illinois in Champaign, We felt like we knew half the people at the event. It was the first time we had gone to a nice hotel party and were very happy with the choice. Everything went very smoothly from Check-in to the bathrooms to the bar service and the DJ's. We loved all the different rooms with DJ's playing different types of music in each. BTW we thought the VIP tickets were well worth the money. I'm sure we will bring a bigger group next year.
- David H. Highland Park, IL
I had heard great things about the Chicago Scene NYE Party at The Drake Hotel, but this was our first time at the party and it was a blast! We stayed at the hotel for three nights and made a great little vacation out of it. A few of our friends that we went to college with at the University of Michigan that live in Chicago invited us to the party and we are very happy we made the trip in. We look forward to coming back to Chicago for New Year's next year.
- Leslie J. Bloomfield Hills, MI
Great Party! I went to school at the University of Indiana and a bunch of guys from my Frat made the party a sort of a 5 year post-graduation reunion. I now live in San Francisco so making the trip back to the cold was not something I was looking forward to. It turned out to be one of the best New Year's Parties I've ever been to!

Millennium Age Silent Party:

The Concept: It’s your typical party…with no speakers or amps. Instead, attendees don wireless headphones and turn them to various stations, then boogie on the dance floor amidst other revelers dancing to whatever’s in their headphones.

The Music: Multiple DJs are competing for your attention during this bash, spinning the hottest music.  If you don’t like a song, simply switch your headphones from one station to the next to keep the party going.

The Social Atmosphere: Party-goers can turn down the volume of their headphones or take them off whenever they want to chat with others. Since there are no blaring speakers, it’s way easier to have conversations and meet new people.

Millennium Ages' Silent Parties have taken over numerous cities with its new silent culture wave. The Silent Party Vibe is undeniable when you experience socializing, dancing, and laughing at your friend's excitement from hearing their favorite songs. Don't overthink it! Come allow us to wow your socks off! Grab your good shoes and your best friends and prepare for a night to remember! See ya there!

The Chosen Few Djs, I Love House Music Chicago & Allay Soul Present: 
You are cordially invited to join A Chosen Fews Djs holiday party Friday, December 23rd at a Brand New Venue for house music, called The Loft!  Alan King, Mike Dunn, Terry Hunter, and Wayne Williams Dj. 8pm-2am. This will sell out!

T?he Chosen Few Djs:
“House Music” is a Chicago original — a genre of dance music known across the globe that was born, nurtured, and developed in Chicago by young DJs, artists, producers, party promoters, and club owners whose collective contributions forged a new sound from elements of disco, Euro dance music, rock and of course, drum machines.
Beginning in the late 1970s and into the early 1980s, a group of popular teen DJs from Chicago’s south side — Wayne Williams, Jesse Saunders, Alan King, Tony Hatchett, and Andre Hatchett — played their unique brand of soulful dance music to huge crowds in packed basements, high school cafeterias and legendary nightspots, including Sauer’s, the Tree of Life, First Impressions, the Playground and the Loft, a club of historic importance in the birth and development of house music. Wayne Williams formalized a DJ collective, originally named “Chosen Few Disco Corp.” in 1977 to meet the high demand for the sound, eventually adding Saunders, King and the Hatchett brothers. In 2006, the group added its first new member in nearly 30 years, legendary DJ and producer Terry Hunter, and in 2012 welcomed DJ and producer Mike Dunn into the ranks.
Along with a handful of other legendary DJs including Frankie Knuckles at the Warehouse, Ron Hardy at the Music Box, and Lil’ Louis on the west side of Chicago, the Chosen Few were the DJs primarily responsible during this period for popularizing the underground dance music that came to be known as house music.
In 1990, the Chosen Few DJs and their longtime friend and Chosen Few member, Kim Parham, had the idea of inviting old friends from the early house music days to a “reunion picnic” in the park behind Chicago’s Museum of Science & Industry. Beginning as a small gathering of family and friends and later dubbed the “old school picnic,” the reunion became an annual event, “The Chosen Few Picnic & House Music Festival”.
The Picnic has grown into one of the largest and most highly anticipated house music festival events in the world, drawing more than 40,000 house music fans from nearly every continent. Each year, the Picnic and its Festival parties feature music and performances from world-renowned guest DJs and dance music artists and of course, the legendary Chosen Few DJs.

We’ve all experienced some kind of embarrassment in our lifetime. Come out and commiserate over some cold beverages at the historic Music Box Theatre. 
WBEZ is presenting three Mortified shows in the upcoming months, and two of them have special themes. In February we’ll celebrate the pinnacle of humiliating holidays, Valentine’s Day. After that, prepare to break out your lightsabers for a Star Wars edition of Mortified on May 4 (the second most embarrassing holiday). 
Witness “personal redemption through public humiliation” in a refreshing show that is equal parts comedic, cathartic and voyeuristic. Mortified is the largest and longest running project of its kind featuring a cast of Chicago’s bravest souls. Share the shame.
Mortified stars everyday people reading aloud their most embarrassing, pathetic and private teenage diary entries, poems, love letters, lyrics and locker notes… in front of total strangers. 
Mortified Chicago is generously sponsored by Goose Island. 

V?IP 
Selecting the VIP add-on during check-out allows you access to the pre-show reception - complimentary drinks provided by Goose Island. As well as priority seating / early access to the theatre. 
G?et the bundle!
Mortified Live will also take place at the Music Box on February 9, 2023 for a special Valentine's Day edition and May 4, 2023 to celebrate the inner Star Wars nerd in all of us! Purchase your tickets ahead of time or bundle all three to save!

An infamous tale, Sweeney Todd, an unjustly exiled barber, returns to nineteenth century London, seeking vengeance against the lecherous judge who framed him and ravaged his young wife. The road to revenge leads Todd to Mrs. Lovett, a resourceful proprietress of a failing pie shop. Mrs. Lovett's luck sharply shifts when Todd's thirst for blood inspires the integration of an ingredient into her meat pies that has the people of London hungry for more. Stephen Sondheim's and Hugh Wheeler's tasty, thrilling, theatrical treat has simultaneously shocked, awed and delighted audiences around the world.

The screening will be followed by an intimate conversation with series co-creators, executive producers, directors, writers and cast Bashir Salahuddin and Diallo Riddle, moderated by WBEZ’s Reset host Sasha-Ann Simons. 
 
Shot on-location in Chicago, South Side follows Simon (Sultan Salahuddin) and K (Kareme Young), two enterprising best friends ready to take over the world as they hustle and dream their way through the Windy City – when they’re not too busy working as furniture repo men at the local Rent-T-Own.

Bashir Salahuddin
Bashir Salahuddin is co-creator, executive producer, writer, director and star of HBO Max’s comedy series South Side. He is an Emmy® nominee for Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, a SAG Awards nominee for GLOW and an NAACP Image Awards winner for his work directing South Side. His recent acting credits include Top Gun: Maverick, The Dropout, Cyrano and Marriage Story. He is also co-creator, executive producer and star of the variety comedy series Sherman’s Showcase on IFC, for which he was nominated for a Critics Choice Award for Outstanding Actor in a Comedy.  

Diallo Riddle 
As an NAACP Image Award-winning director, and Emmy® and WGA-nominated writer, actor, showrunner and producer, not to mention moonlighting DJ, Diallo Riddle has proven to be one of the most multi-faceted talents in the entertainment industry today. Riddle, alongside his creative partner Bashir Salahuddin, have launched many critically acclaimed hit projects over the years through their production company J30 Studios. And they’re just getting started… 
 
In addition to Sherman’s Showcase, Riddle and Salahuddin created, write and star in the HBO Max series South Side, which is slated to debut season three this December. The show follows a rent-to-own business on the south side of Chicago (the Englewood neighborhood) and gives an authentic look into what life on the south side is all about. Seasons one and two of the series were met with critical acclaim; both are Certified Fresh with a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Vanity Fair writes “it's that kind of sharp, careful, hyper local writing that makes South Side a joy.” Paste Magazine hails the show as “wild, weird, and 100% worth visiting,” and Chicago Sun-Times calls it “a fearless, unapologetic, equal opportunity offender.” Riddle won his first NAACP Image Award in 2022 for his work directing the series. The show was also nominated at the 2022 Black Reel Awards for Television in the Outstanding Comedy Series category.

Diamond Sharp’s Super Sad Black Girl is a love letter to her hometown of Chicago, where the speaker finds solace and community with her literary idols in hopes of answering the question: What does it look like when Black women are free?
Lorraine Hansberry and Gwendolyn Brooks appear throughout these poems, counseling the speaker as she navigates her own depression and exploratory questions about the “Other Side,” as do Sandra Bland, Rekia Boyd, and other Black women who have been murdered by police.
Sharp’s poetry is self-assured, playful, and imaginative, reminiscent of Langston Hughes with its precision and brevity. The book explores purgatorial, in-between spaces that the speaker occupies as she struggles to find a place and time where she can live safely and freely. With her skillful use of repetition, particularly in her series of concrete poems, lines and voices echo across the book so the reader, too, feels suspended within Sharp’s lyric moments. Super Sad Black Girl is a compassionate and ethereal depiction of mental illness from a promising and powerful poet.
Join us for this limited-capacity in-person book launch event for Super Sad Black Girl  with Diamond Sharp, Eve Ewing, Raych Jackson and Jamila Woods.  Book signing and reception will follow.
****Masks and proof of vaccination are required for all attendees. Doors will open at 6:00 PM.***
-?-------------------------------------------------

She is the co-author (with Nate Marshall) of the play No Blue Memories: The Life of Gwendolyn Brooks.

Spend 30-60 minutes exploring a three act play where you star as the main character in the world’s first Holographic Theatre presented by Verse Immersive.
The Unreal Garden: Enter The Metaverse is unlike anything you’ve seen before - be the first to tell your friends about the future of storytelling with cutting edge holographic headsets also used by NASA (No nausea!).
No experience required, the perfect entertainment option for work parties, friends-night-out, date night, and creating unforgettable family memories.
Ages 7 and up welcome. Please leave the furry friends at home.
Walk-in tickets are available but they often sell out by 2pm so please book in advance.
Are you imaginary? The Unreal Garden: Enter The Metaverse takes you on a journey through time and space guided by a butterfly who is convinced that you are a part of her imagination! Interact with the environment, feed the animals, collect all the crystals, and maybe if you’re lucky: you’ll find your way back home before you turn into a hologram!
The Unreal Garden: Enter The Metaverse is perfect for first-time “Verse Walkers”. There is no experience required to enjoy the show, but you might not find everything the first time you play.
Remember: Stay curious, look everywhere and touch everything!
Check-in at the Verse Immersive mall kiosk in the front entrance to Navy Pier and they’ll give you instructions for entering the Holographic Theatre.
Wait, what is this?
Somewhere between an interactive Alice in Wonderland and a stroll through the forests of Avatar, The Unreal Garden: Enter the Metaverse is an immersive augmented experience which puts you at the center of an engaging story. You’ll walk around wearing fully transparent headsets while you see and interact with visionary art and unbelievable creatures.
Do I need to bring my own headset?
Nope, we have you covered! Just bring yourself and your phone for selfies!
How long does the experience take?
Plan on spending between 30 and 60 minutes in The Unreal Garden.
Can I transfer my tickets or get a refund?
All Verse Immersive event tickets are non-refundable. If you are not able to make it to the event, feel free to give your ticket to a friend or family member.

It will also feature a performance by L.A. based singer and songwriter, Music Carolyn. Doors open at 6pm. Show starts at 7pm. 
GENE NOBLE
Relentless, powerful, and provocative is how many describe Grammy nominated songwriter & singer Gene Noble’s vocal ability. With his unique vibrato and jaw dropping falsettos, Noble is a crowd pleaser who continues to amaze audiences throughout the US and Europe. Noble is an accomplished songwriter, having written for some of music’s top artist including, Rihanna, Chris Brown, Faith Evans, and more. He is also now a Top 40 artist with his new song “Only Love” (a collaboration with Shaggy and Pitbull) making the rounds on radio stations all over the world. His highly anticipated debut EP - Rebirth of Gene debuted at #16 on iTunes R&B Chart and was rated a “Top 20 R&B Album” by Rhapsody. His sophomore EP - In Dangered Species is set for release in early 2016. Noble’s life began in Manhattan, Kansas as an Army brat. After the death of his father, music became his sanctuary. Noble’s music is influenced by his love of jazz, gospel, rock, pop, and country. After witnessing R&B artist D’Angelo perform on his Voodoo tour, he knew he wanted to become a celebrated performing artist. A native of New York, Noble currently resides in Los Angeles. 
MUSIC CAROLYN
Music Carolyn is the soulful embodiment of ""good vibes only,""."" She marries the sexy of Jill Scott with the joy of Ella Fitzgerald and is part of the soft life that black women are starting to practice. Her most recent EP ""Choose Yourself"" continues to garner praise and her music has recently been featured in Sistas, Twenties, and Flatbush Misdemeanors, as she continues to break new ground with her easy-breezy brand of self-love soul music. Her new single, ""I'm the One,"" follows the single ""Beach of My Own"" which is featured in Season 2 of OWN Series ""Cherish The Day.""

It focuses on work by artists of color, particularly African American authors and artists, as well as comics with a primary character who is Black. Pocket Con also features work in the comic genre by other underrepresented groups, such as women, Latinos, LGBTQ, and other minorities. We have a strong belief in Indie comics and publishing, and welcome small press and self-published authors as well as those involved in related forms of expression and interest, such as webcomics, animation, small-budget film-making, video game design, and zines.
Our mission for this event is primarily to promote literacy using the graphic novel format, reflect on the history of race and gender portrayal in comics and film, and introduce characters, writers, and authors who have a different voice than the primarily white, primarily male, primarily straight characters written by generations of comic authors (themselves primarily white, straight, and male). We would also like to empower young writers and artists by introducing them to the collaborative process that is comic creation and encouraging them to produce and submit work of their own for contests at the con.

ABOUT THE SHOW
Ring in the New Year with a bang! Guided By Voices will play through the midnight countdown, and we’ll have complimentary champagne toasts, party favors and more.
ABOUT THE ARTIST 
In 1994, 38-year-old school teacher Robert Pollard & his merry band recorded Bee Thousand in a Dayton, Ohio, basement on a 4-track cassette recorder. This improbable rock classic became an enormously influential album: Pitchfork and Spin have called it one of the best records of the ’90s, and Amazon picked Bee Thousand as #1 on their list of the 100 Greatest Indie Rock Albums Of All Time. A legendary live band with a rabid following, the Washington Post called GBV “the Grateful Dead equivalent for people who like Miller Lite instead of acid!” With 10 studio albums already under their belts in less than 5 years, the band’s present-day line-up is nothing less than a new Golden Age of GBV.

In 2015, CYSK expanded their weekly showcase to Los Angeles and then to New York City in 2016, making it the only comedian-produced, stand-up comedy showcase to be featured in the three biggest cities in the country!
CYSK features a DIFFERENT LINE-UP every single week and thus makes it a must-see event again and again!

December is a wonderful time for popular music; always has been. For decades, some of our favorite artists have mined the holidays to write songs of emotion and cheer, hoping to create a Christmas classic. Let’s pick the best and play them all in one night, shall we?
Join us on Saturday December 17th at Space in Evanston, as Tributosaurus brings you a Christmas Spectacular.  Through the years we’ve played holiday killers from the likes of The Kinks, Paul McCartney, James Taylor, Bruce Springsteen, and David Bowie…those will be gathered along with songs we’ve always wanted to do from Donnie Hathaway, Darlene Love, and several more. Maybe we’ll slide in a Hannukah track.
Everything will be performed with reverence and authenticity, continuing the now 20 year tradition of the Tributosaurus ethos, where music is the star, and we the happy facilitators.  You are an essential part of the process…come to commune over fabulous holiday music together in the middle of the month.
See you there, with an eggnog in hand.

chicago,https://www.eventbrite.com/e/patrick-watson-with-dana-gavanski-tickets-358606229887?aff=ebdssbdestsearch,Patrick Watson with Dana Gavanski,12/2/2022,,"Thalia Hall 1807 South Allport Street Chicago, IL 60608","This is the biography of Patrick Watson (based on things he told me.) Once there was a boy named Patrick Watson who was born on a military base in the Mojave Desert. His father rode around in planes carrying bombs, waiting for a command to drop them that never came. He was the baby in a family of five, which would include a future figure skater, an engineer and an air force pilot, but he was seven years younger than his next older sibling. The trouble with being born this late into a family is they have all already gone mad, and they are engaged in domestic dramas, chasing each other around with knives. He was left to make too many assumptions about love and life on his own, and he still has the philosophy of a wise beyond their years wide-eyed child.
The family moved to Hudson Quebec when Patrick was four. He was asked by an old gentleman by the name of Frank Cobatt to sing in the church choir. Perhaps they met in the cough drop section of the local grocery store. And Patrick sang in the church and his little boy’s pretty, melancholic voice broke everyone’s heart. And the choir director had him sing at the foot of a grave at a funeral. Because there is something in his voice that captures all the lovely things in life we can only hold onto temporarily and how their transience is what makes them wonderful. 
Patrick started playing piano when he was a child, of course. The piano used to belong to a boy named Gordon. The boy would appear as a ghost and teach Patrick how to play in the middle of the night. Even if Patrick played at three in the morning, his mother never interrupted these vital lessons. He showed me the photo of Gordon who looked, more or less, like a terrifying psychopath with tuberculosis who probably slit his whole family’s throats while they were sleeping. But I did not say so.
Patrick says he became a singer by accident. He thought he would compose scores for others to play, which seems like an odd thing to say because he is so clearly sprinkled with the pixie dust that causes a person to be transfixing on stage. And it’s now hard to imagine Montreal without the soundtrack of his songs.
But he met the artist Brigitte Henry who was taking surreal underwater photographs of people in their clothes to make a book. This seemed like very important business to Patrick, so he made music for her exhibition. They performed the show at the porno movie theatre Cinema L’Amour. It was sold out. Brigitte Henry still designs some of his album covers, including this one.
Patrick likes to hang on to people. He met his first guitar player Simon Angell playing guitar on the small streets of Hudson. In his first jazz class at college he walked in and Robbie Kuster and Mishka Stein were both sitting there. It was as though they were all waiting for each other. They would play together for the next twenty years.
While they were working on his first album, the band lived in an abandoned church. They were kicked out for ringing the church bells when homeless people came in to be married, waking all the neighbours up in the middle of the night, in a misguided attempt to let them know love existed.
They opened up for James Brown where they learned to manage a large crowd. Every day before a concert James Brown and his team would hold hands and pray the show would be amazing. This taught the band that being on stage is a humbling honor and a music show is where people come to have a mystical experience. In the end, it was not so different than when he sang in church as a boy.
While writing this new album, the drummer Robbie left, Patrick and his partner separated, and his mother passed away. Much of this album is about having a wave knock you over when you realize that everything you have in life can be wiped away in a moment. He brought a notebook underneath the waves and composed tunes about melancholy while listening to the lonely hymns of mermaids. And the songs are about how sometimes you have to sing a love song to yourself when no one else will. Melody Noir is about writing a song to the hole inside us all.
Some of the songs, including Turn out the Lights and Look at You, are about falling in love again and learning how to be intimate in a new way. And how surprizing it is that, although life can change, it can turn out to be better in so many ways than you could ever have imagined. And, ultimately, the album is about rebuilding your life from scratch.
The songs are marked by the idiosyncratic personalities of each of his band members. Mishka Stein grew up in the Ukraine where he wore little suits and accidentally set his building on fire, but he did a brave job helping the firemen put it out. A sweet Soviet latchkey boy, he spent much of his time watching Russian cartoons. The influence of the absurd anthemic melodies of those cartoons can be felt in the songs, particularly Look at You and Melody Noir.
Joe Grass, who has been playing guitar and pedal steel since Loves Songs for Robots, is a jackknife of sounds. He always creates a distinctive voice within the band's particular brand of music. Evan Tighe landed magically at the perfect moment to take up the drums. The band was very lucky to find such a great drummer in time.
Patrick also worked with Leonard Cohen on one of his last songs before the legend passed away. This had a profound influence on the way he writes lyrics and the possibilities of poetry in song. The collaboration influenced his vocal delivery to be more dry, to have less notes and to simply deliver the words.
The beginning artist's craft is so intuitive and odd, drawing from a trunk of recipes for happiness and hope. They begin with an idea that the world is good and things and love will work out. The mature artist creates from a place of melancholy and understanding of foibles and accepting a  story that has already been written. It’s the difference between singing a solo at a stranger’s grave as a child and singing one at your own mother’s funeral.
It’s the same magical and sweet Patrick Watson on this album, but each of the feelings are deeper and dive down to stranger places, where even happiness seems impossible to bear. So the album moves from a dark place of loss to one of hope and magic and new love. The way you thought life was going to work out, but never does. Then it sometimes turns out to be more beautiful and surprising once it is broken.

Millennium Age Silent Party:

The Concept: It’s your typical party…with no speakers or amps. Instead, attendees don wireless headphones and turn them to various stations, then boogie on the dance floor amidst other revelers dancing to whatever’s in their headphones.

The Music: Multiple DJs are competing for your attention during this bash, spinning the hottest music.  If you don’t like a song, simply switch your headphones from one station to the next to keep the party going.

The Social Atmosphere: Party-goers can turn down the volume of their headphones or take them off whenever they want to chat with others. Since there are no blaring speakers, it’s way easier to have conversations and meet new people.

Millennium Ages' Silent Parties have taken over numerous cities with its new silent culture wave. The Silent Party Vibe is undeniable when you experience socializing, dancing, and laughing at your friend's excitement from hearing their favorite songs. Don't overthink it! Come allow us to wow your socks off! Grab your good shoes and your best friends and prepare for a night to remember! See ya there!

-------------------
Eggy: Song by timeless song Eggy reaches out a hand, inviting you along as a great story unfolds. Eggy’s music traces the full spectrum of emotions evoked by a life well-lived alongside friends well-loved.
Lunar Ticks: Lunar Ticks are an eclectic Improvisational/Alternative Rock band from Chicago, IL. The band is influenced by the songwriting and studio experimentation of 90's and 2000's innovative Alternative/Indie rock bands like Wilco, My Morning Jacket, The Flaming Lips, Ween, Yo La Tengo, Pavement, and Dr. Dog, and fuses it with genre-bending, progressive musicality, and exploratory improvisations in the vein of The Grateful Dead, Phish, and Umphrey's McGee.  
Lunar Ticks are equally at home on a bill with a folk singer, punk band, free jazz ensemble, you name it. Each setlist is formed from their diverse and expansive song list of originals and covers; debuting new material at almost every show. Extended improvisational passages can turn on a dime or meditate and unfurl in unexpected ways. Lunar Ticks aim to create a unique and memorable experience every time they pick up their instruments.

~ COVID-19 INFORMATION ~
We follow the government and venue guidelines for Covid-19 safety that are in effect at the time of the event. These can change, so please check with your locality. When you arrive at the venue, take a preventative step by washing your hands or use the hand sanitizer we provide. We will have masks for those who need it/want it/or if regulations require. All activities can be modified to be socially distanced by request (your facilitator can guide you through that). If you have cold or flu-like symptoms, or have been exposed, play it safe and stay home. Just let us know and we'll happily refund or transfer your ticket so you can come another time.
 Tantra is thousands of years old (of Hindu and Buddhist tradition) and has become a buzzword, which unfortunately has some misleading definitions. Translated from Sanskrit, it means ""weaving,"" which means bringing oneness to yourself and consciousness to what you do. The exercises are designed to bring you into a state of being more present when you meet your dates. And who doesn't want to be more present, right?
A Puja is an intentional ceremony. In Sanskrit it means reverence, honour, an offering. It is a ritual designed to open our hearts and allow us to see the inner beauty within ourselves and all beings. It invites us into the elegant dance of masculine and feminine in a warm space of oneness and connection--what a great way to start your first date!
Participants form two circles facing each other. The men form the outside circle and the women form the inside, with each woman facing a man. Each pair then share a meaningful exchange through a directed exercise (a Puja “station”), which can be for a few seconds or a few minutes. Then they put their hands together in Namaste, thank each other and--like a speed date--rotate to the next person. The ceremony ends when everyone has rotated a full circle.
Thanks for asking! While the exercises are straightforward and fun, you are always 100% at choice for how you wish to participate. If you find an exercise that doesn't work for you, then--just like in yoga--you have the option to modify or completely opt out.  We encourage everyone to participate at their own comfort level, and our facilitators demonstrate what that looks like so everyone is clear before we begin.
Some events are open and some have a specific age range (stated in the title)--though it's merely a suggestion, not a rule. See our statistics and learn why people love the open events on our FAQ.
We will follow the venue requirements that are in effect at the time of the event. See the Covid-19 Information section the page for your event
As many of our attendees say, ""I don't even care if I match with anyone, this was amazing!"" That said, we geek out on data. Our statistics say there is a 95% chance you'll match with AT LEAST one person. But if for whatever reason the probability fails you, we've got you covered. Your next ticket will be free!
This event is more than just a speed date. It's about bringing more connection, and perhaps healing, to the masculine and feminine within us. That's the juicy part of a connection that makes relationships so fun. Men learn how to hold a grounded masculine space. And when that happens, women can relax into their feminine and not have to do or hold so much. This creates a new way of relating that is easeful and connected, and not something you can ever experience in a bar or on a dating app. We believe this is why people love it so much and why one participant said it will 'restore your hope in dating.'
We're happy to answer! See our FAQ or Contact Us.

3?:30pm - Performance with Krista Franklin and Ben LaMar Gay 
In the first solo museum exhibition of her work, Solo(s): Krista Franklin draws on the artist’s vast range of materials and references, situated at the intersection of poetics, popular culture, and the dynamic histories of the African Diaspora. Often referring to the performance of a single musician, the exhibition’s title, ?Solo(s) is instead guided by the artist’s commitment to collaboration with fellow artists, writers, and musicians. Franklin appropriates text and images from vintage magazine articles and other printed matter that she collects. The very act of collaging—cutting, pasting, and juxtaposing—puts Franklin’s works in direct conversation with the materials of other photographers and writers, transporting her to the time of their original publication. Join Krista Franklin for a conversation in the galleries to learn more about her artistic practice and inspirations followed by a performance with composer Ben LaMar Gay. 
Krista Franklin is a writer, performer, and visual artist, the author Too Much Midnight (Haymarket Books, 2020), the artist book Under the Knife (Candor Arts, 2018), and the chapbook Study of Love & Black Body (Willow Books, 2012). She is a recipient of the Helen and Tim Meier Foundation for the Arts Achievement Award and the Joan Mitchell Foundation Painters and Sculptors Grant. Her visual art has been exhibited at DePaul Art Museum, Poetry Foundation, Konsthall C, Rootwork Gallery, Museum of Contemporary Photography, Studio Museum in Harlem, Chicago Cultural Center, National Museum of Mexican Art, and the set of 20th Century Fox’s Empire. She is published in Poetry, Black Camera, The Offing, Vinyl, and a number of anthologies and artist books.
Ben LaMar Gay is a composer/cornetist who moves sound, color, and space components through folkloric filters to producebrilliant electro-­?acoustic collages.  The unification of various styles is always in service of the narrative and never a pretentious display of technique. Gay’s true technique gives life to an idea while transforming the thought and theory of the term “Americana.” His musical influences derive from his collection of experiences in all the Americas and the gathered data channeled by technology and its amplifying accessibility. The fact that the world is closer via technology and that everyone has access to the possibility of exploring different ideas makes his Avant-­?garde version of “Americana” very global. Embracing global vision while remaining true to his roots, Gay’s creative output aligns with the honest notion that he only knows how to be a man from the Southside of Chicago.

++Wajatta Live++
(Featuring Reggie Watts & John Tejada)
Wajatta is the musical duo of comedian/musician Reggie Watts and electronic music artist/DJ/producer John Tejada. Pronounced wa-HA-ta — it’s a mash-up of the artists’ last names. Flying Lotus’s Brainfeeder record label released their second album “Don’t Let Get You Down” in 2020. 
The duo describe Wajatta's music very broadly as “electronic dance music with its roots in Detroit techno, Chicago house, ‘70s funk and New York hip hop” but new EP “Do You Even Care Anymore?” released on 3rd December 2021 encompasses the next evolution of their sound. “It has developed into something a bit deeper,” says John. “While our process and Reggie’s vocal improvisation work is still the same when we record, there’s just something new that we settled into this time. The music and the lyrics got a bit deeper.”

Guidelines for Peace Peloton Night Market Artists, Creators, Makers, and Partners
Overview
Peace Peloton pursues its mission through our Night Markets, curated to provide a fun and inclusive shopping experience that bring together artists, creators, makers, and vendors (collectively, our “Partners”) in a community setting where neighbors and friends can come together to discover a thriving marketplace and build community. The integrity of our Night Markets is something we take very seriously, and we are committed to operating in a safe, secure, legal, and respectful way. To that end, we have developed these guidelines for our Partners (“Partner Guidelines”) to describe the conduct we require at our Night Markets. Our Partner Guidelines also cover individuals that our Partners invite to the Night Market as guests.
Partner Conduct
Partners must complete and submit the Partner registration that includes acceptance of our Partner Guidelines. Partners may not use the Night Market to engage in any conduct that is (in Peace Peloton’s sole evaluation) offensive, harmful, or inappropriate for general audiences, or that we believe constitutes or is likely to encourage or promote any harmful, violent, or illegal activity or outcome.
Accordingly, Partners will:
•	conduct themselves in a courteous and respectful manner towards the public and Night Market participants. 
•	remain in their allocated space during Night Market hours, and not leave their space unattended. 
•	refrain from any behavior that interferes with the rights of working/selling opportunities of other Partners. 
•	not use language that is offensive, threatening or intimidating to others.
•	not participate in the Night Market under the influence of alcohol or drugs. 
•	only sell and display items that are appropriate for a family friendly venue. 
•	operate vehicles and/ or equipment in a safe and responsible manner. 
•	abide by the Rules and Regulations of the local Municipal and State laws.
•	not smoke or vape except in designated areas. 
•	obtain a sales tax number if required by the state. Will collect and pay any sales tax that may be assessed on their products and will file any required tax returns.
•	educate themselves about complying with all health regulations and licensing requirements governing the production, packaging, display, distribution, sampling, and sale of their products.
Partner Don’ts
A Partner may not use the Night Market to facilitate harmful or criminal activity of any kind. When participating in a Night Market, Partners may not create or sell, or promote events that constitute or promote any of the following, as determined by Peace Peloton:
•	Explicit sexual activity (including escort services), or pornography.
•	Illegal gambling activity (whether illegal under any U.S. federal or state law, or non-U.S. law).
•	Sale or ingestion of illegal drugs, other illegal substances, or nutraceuticals,
•	Cannabis (this is due to regulations at the federal level, and this policy applies even in locations where cannabis is legal).
•	Raffles, sweepstakes, or giveaways that are prohibited by law.
•	Activities that demean, harass, intimidate, threaten, or express hatred toward any societal group, whether based on race, ethnicity, religion, national origin, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, age, or veteran status,
•	Sale, distribution (including raffles, auctions, giveaways), unlawful use, or trade of (i) firearms, firearm parts or hardware, and ammunition; or (ii) weapons and other devices designed to cause physical injury.
Don't Promote Activities by Hateful/Dangerous Organizations
Peace Peloton does not allow any Partner to participate in a Night Market that promotes or encourages hate, violence, or harassment towards others and/or oneself. Specifically, we prohibit Partners that promote hate towards, or the harassment of individuals or groups based on race or ethnic origin, religion, disability, gender, age, nationality, veteran status, sexual orientation, or gender identity. 
Additional Information about our Night Markets
Our neighbors, partners and guests depend on us, so our Night Markets are “rain or shine.” If a Partner is unable to attend, please give us seven (7) days’ notice and Partners unable to attend a Night Market will be added to our Partner wait list to participate in a future Night Market. 
We encourage all local artisans, makers, producers, and vendors to apply to participate in our Night Markets, and we want to ensure that their offerings are truly innovative, original, handmade, or locally produced, and that there is a balance of the types of items sold. Peace Peloton will determine eligibility of products to be sold at each Night Market and has final authority concerning eligibility of Partners and their products. All decisions rendered by Peace Peloton are final.

What is Tantra Yoga?
Well, for starters, it's not what you saw in American Pie! Tantra is thousands of years old (of Hindu and Buddhist tradition) and has become a buzzword, which unfortunately has some misleading definitions. Translated from Sanskrit, it means ""weaving,"" which means bringing oneness to yourself and consciousness to what you do. The exercises are designed to bring you into a state of being more present when you meet your dates. And who doesn't want to be more present, right?
What is a Puja?
A Puja is an intentional ceremony. In Sanskrit it means reverence, honor, an offering. It is a ritual designed to open our hearts and allow us to see the inner beauty within ourselves and all beings. It invites us into the elegant dance of masculine and feminine in a warm space of oneness and connection--what a great way to start your first date!
What does it look like?
Participants form two circles facing each other. The men form the outside circle and the women form the inside, with each woman facing a man. Each pair then share a meaningful exchange through a directed exercise (a Puja “station”), which can be for a few seconds or a few minutes. Then they put their hands together in Namaste, thank each other and--like in speed dating--rotate to the next person. The ceremony ends when everyone has rotated a full circle.
What if I don't feel comfortable doing the exercises?
Thanks for asking! While the exercises are straightforward and fun, you are always 100% at choice for how you wish to participate. If you find an exercise that doesn't work for you, then--just like in yoga--you have the option to modify or completely opt out. Everyone is encouraged to participate at their own comfort level, and our facilitators demonstrate what that looks like so everyone is clear before we begin.
What's the age range?
Some events are open and some have a specific age range (stated in the title)--though it's merely a suggestion, not a rule. See our statistics and learn why people love the open events on our FAQ.
What is the covid-19 policy?
We will follow the venue requirements that are in effect at the time of the event.  See the Covid-19 Information section the page for your event

Emma Willmann is one of New York City’s top comedians, and perhaps one of the only dyslexic-gender-wiggly-comics-with-ADHD from Blue Hill, Maine. In third grade, Mrs. Weller would bribe Emma with the chance to tell a story at the end of every class if Emma promised to stop talking to the other classmates. 
Now, Emma gets to tell stories nightly at The Comedy Cellar, on Netflix’s: The Comedy Line Up, Comedy Central, and is one of the few comics ever to have multiple appearances on The Late Show with Stephan Colbert. All of which has earned Emma a spot on Caroline’s 10 Funniest Comics, Just For Laughs: New Faces, and TimeOut’s 10 Funniest Women in NYC. Emma’s mom is “really proud of all of this but doesn’t like comedy.”
Her hilarious Buttered Up Tour  has already made several stops across the nation. Now on her way to Seattle, from peanut butter to porn preferences, Emma loves talking about everything and is known for the unique ability to authentically connect with all types of audiences, even the occasional heckler.

What is Dungeons and Dragons? 
Dungeons and Dragons is a collaborative storytelling game where one person, the Dungeon Master, plays the narrator and supporting cast while everyone else plays a main character. Dungeons and Dragons has existed since 1970, and continues to be a cultural phenomenon to this day. When you throw Drag Queens into the mix, who knows what magic will come out of the cauldron?  Don’t miss out!
This show is PG-17, there will be cuss words and some sexually graphic descriptions. Parental discretion is advised!

The Seattle based contemporary circus company Acrobatic Conundrum takes up residence in the heart of capitol hill for the ninth installment of their adroitly curated cabaret, featuring a spate of phenomenal acts from the pacific northwest and beyond. 
A door defends. And beckons. It divides. And offers a way in. The circumstances change and an opening we took for granted is lost forever; meanwhile the unexpected saunters in through a window left ajar. In Vol. 9: Thresholds, nine acrobats somersault their way into liminal space, ready to knock on the portal to the unknown. Darting back and forth across the fourth wall, pursuing the thrill of the edge, and pausing only briefly with one hand poised on the knob, Acrobatic Conundrum shares its paean to the doorways of our lives and the opportunities they represent. Because when one door closes, a trapdoor opens. 
Featuring performers Ivanna Wei, PJ Perry, Dream Frohe, Jody Poth, Leah Jones, Duo Maria and Oliver, Emma Curtiss, Gabby Leiva, and Terry Crane.
A?rtistic direction by Terry Crane and Acrobatic Conundrum.
Vol. 9: Thresholds is co-produced with SANCA, the School of Acrobatics  and New Circus Arts.

Lee) found themselves camping and sharing songs around the fire with two dear friends and incredible musicians Adam Roszkiewicz and Leif Karlstrom of the instrumental duo Small Town Therapy. Founding members of the progressive string band Front Country, multi-instrumentalists Adam and Leif bring a new dynamic palette of colors to Kendl and Palmer’s own instrumental prowess and expressive lyricism.
After sharing a handful of new songs and tunes, (and making immediate fans in the campground) there was no doubt that a record was in the future, and In August of 2020 they spent a week out in Enterprise, Oregon recording at the OK Theater.
The new record “Horse Camp” leans towards each member’s string band roots and showcases brand new Lowest Pair songs Kendl and Palmer wrote during the strange times of the pandemic. The album also includes an instrumental by each musician involved. It’s an awesome display of how a simple collaboration of friends can result in music that is as organic as it is undeniable.
“The Perfect Plan is masterfully crafted.” -American Songwriter
""Ollella’s career as a musician started early, when she sang before she could talk. Trained as a classical cellist since the age of nine, the Seattle indie-folk musician merges her technical background with authoritative vocals, live-looping, and improvisation. Described as “really outstanding” by NPR Music’s Bob Boilen and “so tastefully done” by Michelle Zauner (Japanese Breakfast), Ollella blends the acoustic with the contemporary, folk with pop, and tenacity with softness. Her playing has been featured in films screened at Film Festivals such as Sundance and Aspen Film Fest, on recordings with others including Grammy-winning artist Peter Kater, and has shared the stage with popular Americana acts such as the Shook Twins and Rising Appalachia.
”Ollella” is pronounced oh-lel-uh.""

In a testament to the unbridled imagination and extraordinary grace of their musicianship, each track on Songs for the Sparrows ineffably evokes the sensation of roaming through the unknown. True to the album’s spirit of loving inclusivity, Lindberg and Zasloff, have created an elegantly wayward sound by melding elements of everything from Americana and Appalachian bluegrass to Celtic folk and Eastern European music. Not only a reflection of their vast musical knowledge, that open-hearted embracing of so many eclectic genres also speaks to the joyful curiosity that animates every aspect of their artistry.”

Cassian is a live electronic musician currently based in Los Angeles. An accomplished producer, DJ, and mixing engineer, he has cemented his name as one of the most versatile talents to emerge from Sydney's flourishing electronic scene. In 2018, Cassian became the first artist on RU?FU?S DU SOL's imprint Rose Avenue, where he's released buzzing singles ""Lafayette,"" ""Same Things,"" and ""Magical"" with ZOLLY (Phil Slabber of Crooked Colours). A respected and seasoned performer, Cassian has played for tens of thousands alongside the likes of Hayden James, Dom Dolla, RU?FU?S DU SOL, and Yotto, while also selling out headline shows and commanding festival sets. Now, after a year filled with new singles and remixes, a second ARIA award, and a Grammy nomination, he's gearing up to release his long-awaited debut album, ?Laps:? a raw, analog-driven LP showcasing his tenacity for polished songwriting and dramatic sonic landscapes. Cassian is undeniably coming into his own as an artist, and it's impossible not to be excited for what's to come.

?? ABOUT NOISE COMPLAINT ??
Gone is the party where the music and the people at the party mattered more than making money. As Electronic Dance Music has exploded in popularity over the last several years, so have crowds and ticket prices along with it. In the beginning, events were held in underground, often intimate venues. It was about the music, and it was about each other.
Noise Complaint is taking it back to its roots, bringing the people quality, dance floor focused house and techno all while pushing that party-don't-stop vibe that everyone loves. We're bringing in huge talent - DJs and producers that are well known and respected but that we also personally vibe with. We're doing this at a small price, and in an intimate space. It's about the music for us, it's about the party and the vibe and the memories and friends you will make. Every Noise Complaint should be the best party you've been to since well, the last Noise Complaint.
We're more than just a party, we're a movement. Join us and become part of the family.

Is there an age requirement?
Due to the content of the show, we require that all audience members be 21 years of age or older.
---
Is there a drink minimum / will there be food & drink at the event?
No, there is not a drink minimum and there IS NOT food/drinks at the venue. The show will have some basic concessions available for sale just in case, but you may want to come prepared with your own food/drinks.
Because, you never know, you just might need some snacks.
---
Can we get high inside the venue?
No. This is not a dab lounge or an indoor smoking venue. That being said, we DO take an intermission for a reason and what you do once you leave the venue is your own business. We won't stop you and we aren't snitches.
---
Can we get high with the comedians?
We book the comedians to be comedians. That means they are only required to tell jokes, get a little high and tell more jokes. If they want to do the high part with everyone, we encourage it. Otherwise, it's more about creating a comfortable environment for these comedians to get stoned without having to worry about interaction with people. Some of the comedians do not regularly smoke and it is important that we keep them relaxed. We don't want them to have a freak out because one of you is too intense.
We all have that friend.

This event is being presented in person at Central Library, with the option to view the livestream from home. It is presented in partnership with Open Books, and supported by The Seattle Public Library Foundation and the Gary and Connie Kunis Foundation. Thanks to media sponsor The Seattle Times. The event will be recorded, captioned and then posted on SPL's YouTube channel after the event. 



About the Speaker: Jenny Liou is an English professor at Pierce College and a retired professional cage fighter. She lives and writes in Covington, Washington.





About the Book: In Muscle Memory, Washington-based poet Jenny Liou grapples with violence and identity, beginning with the chain-link enclosure of the prizefighter’s cage and
 radiating outward into the diasporic sweep of Chinese American history. Liou
 writes with spare, stunning lyricism about how cage fighting offered relief from the
 trauma inflicted by diaspora’s vanishing ghosts; how, in the cage, an elbow splits an
 eyebrow, or an armbar snaps a limb, and even when you lose a fight, you’ve won
 something else: pain. Liou places the physical manifestation of violence in her sport
 alongside the deeper traumas of immigration and her own complicated search for
 identity, exploring what she inherited from her Chinese immigrant father—who
 was also obsessed with poetry and martial arts. When she finally steps away from
 the cage to raise children of her own, Liou begins to question how violence and
 history pass from one generation to the next, and whether healing is possible
 without forgetting.





About the curator: Shin Yu Pai is former program director of Town Hall Seattle and curated and produced events for Atlas Obscura, while leading public programs for Atlas Obscura Society in Seattle for five years. She is the author of 11 books of poetry and a 2022 Artist Trust Fellow. She is host and creator of The Blue Suit, a podcast on Asian American stories produced by KUOW Public Radio, Seattle’s NPR affiliate.

Youtube.com/andrewjrivers
Q: Is this a Family Friendly Show?

VIP ticket will reserve you a ticket close to the front and I'll give you a free beer koozie at the show. Plus afterwards, I'll email you a digital download package with all of my comedy. Most of it is available for free on the internet anyway, but this is basically a way of throwing me some extra cash because you feel like it. Plus you don't have to go scouring the internet to find it.

The curriculum I followed is based on the scientific studies in the field of Music-Medicine and is also a governed by The National Standards Board for Therapeutic Musicians (NSBTM). As part of my graduation requirements I completed an internship playing music one-on-one at the bedside. I worked with hospice patients at Bayview Retirement Community and also with patients in the Critical Care and Oncology Units at Virginia Mason Medical Center.
A CMP’s work differs from that of a Music Therapist in that we do not actively involve the patient in the creation of music. A CMP plays music for the direct benefit of the patient with the goal of creating a healing environment. My hope is that this environment extends beyond the patient to any family members, partners or staff who may be visiting or providing care to the patient.
I currently work at Virginia Mason Medical Center and with Kaiser Permanente providing therapeutic music.

The holiday season can be a particularly isolating time for folks, so we thought we’d throw a giant Winter Wonderland bash to bring the community together and support a local charity. 

We’re partnering with Bowl-A-Noma, a community organization that supports research into the diagnosis and treatment of Melanoma, to turn The Dock Sports Bar & Grill into a Weak Ties Winter Wonderland!  All ticket proceeds will go toward the support of research and patients of Melanoma.
You won’t want to miss this event, we’ll have: 
An Ugly Sweater Contest: Grab your ugliest holiday sweater and come join us. We’ll be having a giant ugly sweater contest with prizes for:
- Best Ugly Holiday Sweater
- Best Thrifted Ugly Holiday Sweater
- Audience Favorite Sweater

Themed Drinks: The dock is working hard on putting together holiday-themed drink specials to get you in the holiday spirit with actual spirits. 

A DJ: We’re bringing a DJ in to play your favorite holiday singles and today’s top hits. 

Holiday Themed Games: What better way to get to know your community than playing pin the nose on the snowman? We’ll have several holiday-themed games as well as all your favorite board games! 

A Silent Auction: We’ll have a charity silent auction with all proceeds going to our partner cause Bowl-A-Noma! Come bid on some great items and raise money for Melanoma research. 

Weak Tie Ticket Sales: This event is a weak-ties event which means when you buy a ticket you’re actually buying two! Bring your best friend or your roommate, use it as an excuse to ask out your hinge date, or the person you’ve always needed a reason to talk to! This event is designed for establishing new connections in your community all while having fun! Just moved here? We’ll also have solo tickets so you can jump-start your social circle! All ticket sales will be donated to the organization to further the research and patient support of Melanoma.

Grab your tickets, prepare your ugly holiday sweaters and we’ll see you there! 



Bowl-A-Noma is a heartfelt attempt to make something wonderful and worthwhile out of the heart-breaking, tragic, death of Elliott Hathaway Hull. Diagnosed with Stage IV Metastatic Melanoma in June of 2018, Elliott passed away just four months later due to no effective form of therapy. While in the final days of his illness, Elliott gave to his father his wholehearted approval of organizing an effort to fight Melanoma. Elliott was a Seattle native, served in Afghanistan, was married, and had a 2-year-old son at the time of his passing
It is to Elliott's memory that Bowl-A-Noma is dedicated. BOWL-A-NOMA continues to support research into the diagnosis and treatment of Melanoma. It also provides financial & emotional assistance to Melanoma patients and their families through grants made to cancer treatment facilities. More information can be found at their website: https://www.bowlanoma.org 
Melanoma also hits home for both The Dock Sports Bar & Grill and the Seattle Social Club. 
Jacquelyn,  a founding member of The Dock and the owners' sister,  is in a current battle and beating Melanoma. 
And I  was never able to meet my grandfather, as he passed away from Melanoma when I was 1 year old. It's in his memory that the Seattle Social Club commits to raising money for Melanoma Research.

The weak ties premise: At the Seattle Social Club, we're fascinated by the idea of weak ties. Weak ties are the people you meet at parties, friends of friends, coworkers, and other people you interact with in your daily lives. Research shows that fostering your weak ties can lead to increased happiness and an increased sense of belonging in your community. Weak ties also serve as a way for you to meet potential dates, many people meet their future spouses through their weak ties. Unfortunately, since Covid has come along, it’s been way harder to increase your weak ties and even harder to date!
 So when you purchase a ticket you are actually buying one for yourself and one for a friend. Bring your single friend, the guy you run into in your building elevator, a friend of a friend, or even one of your matches from a previous event. Everyone else will bring their weak ties and we'll get together and mingle with each other. You may walk away with a new date, a new friend, or just a fun time!



We offer several different ticket types and while this event is designed to bring a friend, we offer several options to make sure everyone is able to attend! 
- Weak Tie ticket: This is the default ticket tier and is for those who are attending and bringing a weak tie.
- Solo Ticket: This ticket is for those who want to attend but can’t find a weak tie to bring.
- Donation Ticket: This ticket is for those that want to attend and are willing to donate more to support the fight against Melanoma.

Vechornytsi were traditional gatherings of young people with music, songs, jokes, games and rituals and were very popular in the old days. At these parties people cooked delicious dinners, created folk art objects, met new friends and socialized. While traditional vechornytsi were mostly attended by young people, our event is  for your entire family.
Come and immerse yourself into this beautiful Ukrainian tradition. Enjoy national homemade dishes and a jolly performance filled with music and songs. All proceeds from the tickets, food and merchandize sales will be donated for humanitarian support. Everyone needs to feel the spirit of the holidays, even during the worst of times.

A mainstay of the indie music scene, Death Cab for Cutie has been consistently recording and touring for over two decades.

FAQ
Q. Will I be able to attend without a ticket?
A. All attendees will be required to have a ticket to see our concert. Tickets are still free, as always. We advise people to get their tickets in advance, before the show. 
Q. Can I get tickets in person?
A. We will be able to do tickets day of at the concert. There will be a limited number of day of tickets, so it is advised to get tickets before the concert. Tickets gotten day of will be available at the Ticket Booth. Online Ticket Sales will close at 1:00pm on March 24th. 
Q. How do I check in at the concert?
A. We will have volunteers scanning in tickets at the show. The Upstairs lobby will only be accessible by those checked into the concert. Your tickets can be scanned in off your phone (tickets are sent to your email) or we can scan in printed off versions of your ticket. We can also look up tickets by name.
Q. Why are we doing tickets now?
A. The orchestra has seen significant increases in community interest in our concerts. We love having so many people come and enjoy our music, but we also have to keep our patrons safety in mind. By implementing tickets, we can make sure we stay within the capacity limits for the Auditorium. It also helps us to know how many people are coming to our concerts, which will help us make future decisions for the Orchestra, and how to best accommodate our growth as an orchestra. 
Q. How can I reserve tickets in advance for future concerts?
A. We have decided to use EventBrite to provide free tickets for our concerts. We will typically release tickets to the public one month before our concerts. You can search for us on EventBrite, follow us on Facebook (www.facebook.com/PoulsboCommunityOrchestra/) where we will post updates on tickets, or join our mailing list where you will receive an email when tickets become available, along with a link to our Event on EventBrite.
Q. I’m apart of your email list, but I didn’t receive an email about tickets?
A. We’re sorry you didn't receive an email alert. The email could have ended up in your spam folder, in which case you would want to unmark it as spam. If it never arrived at all, it could be that your email is not entered properly on our end of things. If the latter is the case, you can submit your email to us again, either in person, or online through our email collection service on Facebook or our website. (www.poulsbocommunityorchestra.org)
Q. What are Rush Tickets?
A. Rush Tickets are tickets that become available at 2:50pm. They are tickets from people who couldn’t make it to the show, and have now been released to anyone trying to get tickets day of. Rush tickets are selected on a ‘Best Available’ case, and our system will try to seat groups together where possible. 
Q. How can I support PCO?
 A. We accept donations large or small.  You can donate at our website, www.poulsbocommunityorchestra.org . We also have several donation boxes at our concerts around the lobby that you can use to donate with cash or check. We also have a card reader upstairs for donations via card. Donations are what helps us keep our concerts free to the public. We also are almost always looking for volunteers to help us with tickets and ushering at our concerts. If you’re interested in volunteering in the future, talk to our Production Manager, Hazelynne Meyer.

It's an exciting new twist on online speed dating! Let's face it, we're all tired of swiping over and over again on people who may or may not look like or be like the person they're portraying on the apps. A Play & Date online speed dating event is a much better way to meet someone because you actually get to talk to someone on video before committing to a real life date. This is the safest and best way to meet someone!
Our friendly host will welcome everyone and then you'll be grouped off into breakout rooms where you'll get to meet, chat with and play fun social games with other singles. At the end of the event you'll be able to indicate  people you'd like to talk to again in the future through our matching system. If they're also interested in you we'll give you each other's contact information. Find out why this event has been called, ""The absolute best way to meet quality singles in the modern age"". No more endless swiping on dating apps!
WHAT MAKES THIS EVENT DIFFERENT?
This is entirely new and revolutionary type of speed dating event! We love the idea of traditional speed dating but sometimes it's hard to come up with things to talk about. That's why at a Play & Date speed dating event you'll have fun, easy games to play to get to know everyone instead of dealing with the usual dating ""job interview"" type questions. We find that it's a much better way to get to know someone! You'll be put in Zoom breakout rooms with a small group of singles and you'll play fun icebreaker style games that will help you get to know each other. Essentially you'll work with the other people as a team and compare answers with the other teams (we explain the games in more detail below).  Throughout the game we'll switch up the groups/teams so you'll get to meet all of the singles in attendance from your city. 
* At each event we'll have a few different cities in attendance and sometimes we may mix in some singles from different cities into your group... but don't worry... we'll make sure you get to meet all the singles in attendance from your city **

WHAT KIND OF GAMES WILL WE BE PLAYING?
The fun games are set up to break the ice, help you gauge compatibility and make quality connections. An example game we like to play is ""Dating Feud"" which is similar to the popular prime time TV show we all know. In this game you and your dates will be asked fun relationship style questions like, ""Name a gift that women love men to give them"". You will work together with a small group of singles to come up with what you think is the most popular answer and then you'll find out if you got the top answer. Another game we play is ""Would You Rather"" where we ask you fun questions like ""Would you rather live the rest of your life without ever being able to watch and movie/TV show or would you rather never be able to listen to any song/music again?"". You answer the question and then you have to try and pick the most popular answer.  You're then brought back from the breakout room into the main room to hear how everyone else answered the question. It's so much fun!
Thousands of people have met at our events and we've witnessed countless relationships formed. In fact, because you really get to know people during the games, the chances of meeting someone at Play & Date speed dating events are much higher than online dating apps or traditional speed dating events.

MORE DETAILS:
* Once you sign up, you'll be given a link to join a group of other people via video on Zoom. All you need is a laptop, phone or tablet to take part in the event. You'll enjoy an evening of meeting new people, fun social interactions and games. Our friendly host will be with you live via video orchestrating the event and even making introductions among the group so you'll get to know the other people attending. It's so much fun!

WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING ABOUT THE EVENT:
""As a busy professional, I just don't have time to get out and meet people as much as I'd like so this event was like a Godsend for me. It was a refreshingly fantastic experience."" - Jennifer S.
""The games are the perfect way to tell if you have chemistry with the the other  people."" - Emma D.
""What a fabulous concept. I met some great people and I started dating one of the guys I met  during the event."" - Hannah M.
""That was an absolute blast!"" - Laura D.
""I loved the games because it takes the pressure off having to come up with things to talk about so there is no time for awkward silences. It's makes a great ice breaker."" - Gavin B.

WHY THIS EVENT WORKS!
For many years we organized in person traditional speed dating events. While waiting for everyone to show up, the host would do some icebreaker style games to ""kill time"" until everyone arrived. We noticed something fascinating begin to happen. People got to know each other better and made more connections during the games than they did during the actual speed dating rounds! The games sparked so much conversation and laughs that we thought, ""Wow, we should make an entire event like this!"". And that is how our Play & Date online speed dating events were born.

QUICK NOTE: THESE EVENTS WILL LIKELY SELL OUT BY EVENT TIME AND WE HAVE LIMITED SPOTS AVAILABLE  AT EACH EVENT SO GRAB YOUR TICKET ASAP!

FAQ:
IF I ATTENDED A PAST EVENT PLAY & DATE SPEED DATING, CAN I SIGN UP FOR THIS ONE?

For decades, Black and white actors had been shot with similar lighting, leading to an unnatural glare and loss of facial features of Black performers. In the 1967 production In the Heat of the Night, Poitier asked the cinematographer Haskell Wexler to adjust the lighting for Poitier so the actor’s features were as clear as those of white cast members. This would forever alter the course for thousands of Black actors all over the world, as their ability for their performances to be filmed correctly entered into the discourse, and continues to this day.



Poitier lived a life of service to racial and societal justice, including being a founding member of the Committee for the Negro in the Arts (CNA), a leftist group of Black artists that led him to be blacklisted during the height of the McCarthy era anti-Communism. At the behest of his friend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr, Poitier was asked to deliver $70,000 to southern civil rights activists and was pursued and shot out in a high-speed chase in Jackson, Mississippi. Swearing never to return to the American south, he broke that promise to film his seminal movie, In the Heat of the Night. Sidney Poitier’s life was full of the immeasurable burden of being a Black leading man during a time when Hollywood allowed so few others to walk with him. His legacy stands tall as an icon, a beacon, and a trailblazer not only as an actor but as a man.

(pl?netes) – with the West Coast premiere of Timothy Takach’s choral sojourn, Helios. This fifteen-movement, concert-length work begins in the outermost reaches of the Solar System, with Pluto, and travels inward, to our Sun. The libretto of Helios is a combination of published and commissioned poems from contemporary writers as well as translations of ancient texts, and the theme of each planetary movement is inspired by the mythology or science of its namesake.
Positioned at the nexus of science, faith, and humanity, Helios includes a narrative of control and chaos, exploring that which is within our control, that which is not, and showing that we have the power to change our trajectory. The music provides a constantly changing landscape of textures, soundscapes, vocal techniques and harmonic language.
To accompany his astronomical work, Tim commissioned a series of visual projections that will run simultaneously with the concert. He collaborated with Deborah Johnson (aka CandyStations), an interdisciplinary artist and designer who has created projections for Sufjan Stevens, Sofi Tukker, St Vincent, Kronos Quartet, and Wilco.

When History meets Class, the Evolution of an Experience:
ROYALTY a Lifestyle AND Movement.
When searching for any location, especially a 5MadeMen.com, LLC event location, ALL aspects have to be just right. Great attention is put into all levels of the overall experience from details in flooring to the lighting, how one room flows into the next, and making sure space is ample but not overpowering. Where the atmosphere is classic and legendary, and the view accentuates the heart of the city. Where the foundation is strong, and the history is everlasting, EVERYTHING has to be flawless.
Join us as the foundation is laid for the evolution of the CHAMPAGNE LIFE Experience and the continuation of a lifestyle movement.

In 2008 more than 30 million
 television viewers fell in love with his angelic voice, making him runner-up in Season 7
 of “American Idol.” His first single “Crush,” debuted at #2 on the Billboard Hot 100
 chart, eventually going double platinum after selling more than 2 million digital copies, worldwide.

After a few more albums, appearing as a guest star on The Mormon Tabernacle Choir’s
 holiday album, and starring in a mini-series in the Philippines, Archuleta (a member of
 The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) put his singing career on hiatus so he
 could serve a two-year stint as a missionary outside of Santiago, Chile.

Since his return to music in 2014, David successfully began releasing music under his
 own indie label, Archie Music. Regularly selling out two domestic tours a year and with a
 total of nine studio albums under his belt, Archuleta now resides in Nashville where, in
 his downtime, he's able to collaborate with other songwriters and musicians. His most
 recent album 'Therapy Sessions,' which Billboard magazine dubbed as his “most
 vulnerable music yet,” narrates Archuleta's lifelong struggle with mental health.

“Whether it was fear, loss, dwelling on the past, or anxiety. There’s a constant battle
 going on because so much of my mind doesn’t want to budge. The songs are a sort of a
 back and forth within the inner dialogue I have with myself,"" says David.

Due to COVID-19 restrictions, Archuleta was forced to postpone touring, however has
 since been rescheduled and will resume in 2022.

BIOGRAPHY
Graham Russell & Russell Hitchcock met on May 12, 1975, the first day of rehearsals for ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" in Sydney, Australia; they became instant friends with their common love for The Beatles and, of course, singing.
After the shows' performances at 10:30, they would play pizza parlors, coffee bars and night clubs with just one guitar and two voices. They quickly gained a reputation for great harmonies and for original songs that Graham was constantly writing. They made a demo on a cassette of two songs, ""Love and Other Bruises"" and ""If You Knew Me"" and took it to every record company in Sydney. Everyone turned it down but one -- CBS Records—who admired their unique style.
They made a single in one afternoon and it shot to number one on the national charts. Air Supply was born! That same year, they opened for Rod Stewart across Australia and then throughout the U.S. and Canada playing all of the famous huge venues before Rod would take the stage. They found new fans, but did not break the U.S. market.
Back in Australia they had to start again and made a record called Life Support. On this record were some treasures of songs, including ""Lost in Love"" which went Top 10 in Australia and somehow found its way to music industry executive Clive Davis in New York.
Clive immediately signed Air Supply to Arista Records and in 1980, ""Lost in Love"" became the fastest selling single in the world, leaping to the top of all of the charts. Now Air Supply was on their way. The second single was ""All Out of Love,"" and that went up the charts even quicker. Seven top-five singles later, Air Supply at that time had equaled The Beatles' run of consecutive top five singles. The album Lost in Love,The One That You Love, Now & Forever, and The Greatest Hits sold in excess of 20 million copies. ""Lost in Love"" was named Song of the Year in 1980, and, with the other singles, sold more than 10 million copies.
The trademark sound of Russell Hitchcock's soaring tenor voice and Graham Russell's simple yet majestic songs created a unique sound that would forever be known as Air Supply.
However, it is the live shows that always hold audiences captive around the world. They were the first Western group to tour China, Taiwan, and countless other countries that before would not allow pop music across their borders. In 1983 they recorded ""Making Love Out Of Nothing At All"" by Jim Steinman which solidified the group as a permanent force in modern music. This song was released on
The Greatest Hits album which soared past 7 million copies. ""Lost in Love"", ""All Out of Love"", ""The One That You Love"", ""Sweet Dreams"", and ""Making Love Out Of Nothing At All"" have each achieved multi-million plays on the radio.
In 1986 the group's music was still playing endlessly on radio. That same year, Graham was married to actress Jodi Varble from Rochelle, Illinois, who also was his leading lady in the video for ""Making Love Out Of Nothing At All.""
Air Supply began to tour with lavish productions in places that no one had been before. In South America and Asia they became a part of everyone's life. In 1988, Air Supply was asked to participate in Australia's bicentennial celebration and to play for HRH Prince Charles and HRH Princess Diana, where they learned both were already ardent fans. This engagement would be one of their most treasured moments in their career.
In 1989, they recorded ""The Earth Is"" album selling over a million copies outside of the U.S. This album was followed by ""The Vanishing Race"" CD and, with the singles ""Goodbye"" and ""It's Never Too Late"", again saw multi-platinum success. The following albums, ""News from Nowhere"", ""Yours Truly"", and ""Across the Concrete Sky"" all gave their second greatest hits album multi-platinum status as they traveled the world each and every year.
In 2000, a new production company was founded to be devoted to Air Supply's entire future product, called A Nice Pear, which gave them complete creative control.
In July 2005, their live DVD, ""It Was 30 Years Ago Today"" celebrated 30 years of success around the world and in that same month, Air Supply smashed attendance records when, in Cuba, at one show they played to 175,000 people. Also 2005 saw the release of ""The Singer and the Song"", an acoustic album of many of their big hits which recieved critical acclaim.
In May 2010, the long-awaited album, ""Mumbo Jumbo""–also the duo's first studio recording in eight years-was released. Recorded at Graham Russell's home studio near Park City, Utah and at Odds On's state of the art facilities in Las Vegas with top session musicians and an orchestra, ""Mumbo Jumbo"" was produced by Russell and engineered by Odds On's Sean O'Dwyer, whose credits include Pink Floyd, Randy Newman and Blink-182. Among the 14-tracks, released by Odds On's label, was the first single ""Dance With Me,"" which earned Air Supply a prominent feature article in Billboard Magazine titled ""Still Supplying The Hits After 35 Years.""
Just weeks after composer and vocalist Graham Russell was honored with a BMI Million-Air Certificate recognizing 3 million performances of the duo's hit ""All Out Of Love,"" Air Supply's new song was the #1 most added track on the FMQB AC40 Chart, and also one of the most added on the R&R (Radio and Records) AC Chart and the Mediabase AC chart.
In 2013, the duo was inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association’s Hall of Fame. Air Supply celebrated their 40th anniversary in 2015 and continue to delight audiences all over the world.

Millennium Age Silent Party:

The Concept: It’s your typical party…with no speakers or amps. Instead, attendees don wireless headphones and turn them to various stations, then boogie on the dance floor amidst other revelers dancing to whatever’s in their headphones.

The Music: Multiple DJs are competing for your attention during this bash, spinning the hottest music.  If you don’t like a song, simply switch your headphones from one station to the next to keep the party going.

The Social Atmosphere: Party-goers can turn down the volume of their headphones or take them off whenever they want to chat with others. Since there are no blaring speakers, it’s way easier to have conversations and meet new people.

Millennium Ages' Silent Parties have taken over numerous cities with its new silent culture wave. The Silent Party Vibe is undeniable when you experience socializing, dancing, and laughing at your friend's excitement from hearing their favorite songs. Don't overthink it! Come allow us to wow your socks off! Grab your good shoes and your best friends and prepare for a night to remember! See ya there!

FAQs

Are there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?
No ID is required. We do not recommend our shows for children under 14 years of age. Plots may involve adult situations or mature themes (infidelity, drug use, gambling). Humor may contain mild adult innuendo.
 
What are my parking options for getting to and from the event?
Free public parking is available in the parking garage directly across from Hotel (Sundance Square Garage #3 @ 345 W 3rd St — just footsteps away). Parking is complimentary in this garage after 6pm on Fridays.  

Also, guests of Keith & Margo’s MURDER IN SUNDANCE SQUARE are welcome to use The Aloft Fort Worth Downtown Hotel valet parking for a discounted rate of $20 per car. 
 
How can I contact the organizer with any questions?
Our office number is 817-572-2212. Mondays through Fridays 10:00am to 5:00pm. Email is info@murdermysterytexas.com
 
What's the refund policy?  Is my ticket transferrable?
All sales are final and nonrefundable. No exceptions. However, if you can't make the show, you are allowed to give someone else your ticket for that date.
 
Do I have to bring my printed ticket to the event?
No. Your name will be on the check-in list with our Mystery Host at the door. We will email you a confirmation with directions and additional information, however.
 
Is it ok if the name on my ticket doesn't match the person who attends?
Yes.
 
How can members of a group sit together if they reserve separately?
When reserving, you are asked if you are part of a larger group. If you are, type your group name (e.g. The Smith Party, or The Jones Party) into the space provided, and we will sit you all together.
 
Is it gory or scary?
Stage Blood is used, but nothing too graphic. This is not like a haunted house experience. No one is going to leap out and try to scare you.
 
Is the murder mystery before or after the dinner?
During. It begins the moment you park your car, and ends only as you exit the venue.
 
May I take pictures?
Yes!  We encourage it... as long as you tag it (if you upload it to social media) as KEITH & MARGO'S MURDER MYSTERY TEXAS.

Milsap provided country music with one of its most important voices, as the genre was moving beyond its rural roots into the mainstream of modern entertainment. Country music couldn’t have found a man more suited to lead the charge.
Steeped in the mountain music of the North Carolina hills and schooled in classical piano, Milsap early in life found inspiration in a wide variety of music. Even as he mastered Beethoven and Mozart, his heart belonged to hard core country and rhythm-and-blues -- music he heard beamed from powerful radio stations located in Nashville. Those earthy sounds about life and love provided a young, impoverished blind boy with a connection to a world beyond the harsh reality of his daily existence.

These charming identical twins have some of the most popular channels on YouTube. They earned a respectable 3 million loyal subscribers and grossed over 400 million views all before their first television appearance.
 Originally from Virginia, Kevin and Keith took the long route on their way to the entertainment industry. They were naturally entertaining, but took brief detours along their professional path to explore careers in finance and the U.S. Marine Corps. It wasn't until Keith had the idea that he and his 6'4"" twin titan should quit their jobs, at the same company, no less, and follow their dreams of making people laugh while inspiring them to live healthier lives. Kevin agreed, and the rest is Hodgetwins history.
 These handsome siblings have quickly earned a cult following and have a global appeal. A single video or candid photo can easily surpass a few thousand views or comments in one day. It is evident that people enjoy their unique interaction, comedic catchphrases, and edgy sense of humor.

Are fans of the visiting team and large groups allowed?
Absolutely!  We welcome all fans of all teams (yes, even Washington fans) with southern hospitality and Texas charm!  Approximately half of our guests are from out of state, and there are always fans of the visiting teams at the party!  And, we can accommodate your group of nearly ANY SIZE.

Are kids allowed?
Kids of all ages under 21 are allowed to attend (but NO ALCOHOL for them), but will need a ticket if they are over 2.  Unfortunately, we cannot offer a discount for these tickets. 

What are my transportation/parking options getting to the event?
Limos, taxis, and private buses often drop guests off right in front of the restaurant.  There is no parking onsite as the tailgate takes up the entire parking lot.  If you are parking a vehicle, we highly encourage you to buy parking in advance online.

Do I have to bring my printed ticket to the event?
We can scan tickets electronically on your phone.  If you've lost your printed tickets, we can generally check you in guest-list style without a ticket if your entire party shows up together. 

I don't have a ticket to the game...can I stay and watch the game at Boiling Tails?
The tailgate party will close at kickoff.  Subject to opening hours and capacity available inside the restaurant, you are welcome to watch the game there.  Food and Drink inside the restaurant is NOT INCLUDED in the price of admission to the tailgate party.

What is the refund policy?
Refunds are offered up to 7 days in advance of the event, or if the event is cancelled. NO REFUNDS FOR LATE ARRIVALS OR NO-SHOWS.  However, over  the past 10 years the tailgate has not been cancelled and has been held in rain, shine, extreme Texas heat, and ""ice bowl"" conditions.   ALSO, NOTE THAT EVENTBRITE'S TICKETING FEES ARE NON-REFUNDABLE.

Are fans of the visiting team and large groups allowed?
Absolutely!  We welcome all fans of all teams (yes, even Washington fans) with southern hospitality and Texas charm!  Approximately half of our guests are from out of state, and there are always fans of the visiting teams at the party!  And, we can accommodate your group of nearly ANY SIZE.

Are kids allowed?
Kids of all ages under 21 are allowed to attend (but NO ALCOHOL for them), but will need a ticket if they are over 2.  Unfortunately, we cannot offer a discount for these tickets. 

What are my transportation/parking options getting to the event?
Limos, taxis, and private buses often drop guests off right in front of the restaurant.  There is no parking onsite as the tailgate takes up the entire parking lot.  If you are parking a vehicle, we highly encourage you to buy parking in advance online.

Do I have to bring my printed ticket to the event?
We can scan tickets electronically on your phone.  If you've lost your printed tickets, we can generally check you in guest-list style without a ticket if your entire party shows up together. 

What is the refund policy?
Refunds are offered up to 7 days in advance of the event, or if the event is cancelled. NO REFUNDS FOR LATE ARRIVALS OR NO-SHOWS.  However, over  the past 10 years the tailgate has not been cancelled and has been held in rain, shine, extreme Texas heat, and ""ice bowl"" conditions.   ALSO, NOTE THAT EVENTBRITE'S TICKETING FEES ARE NON-REFUNDABLE.

Here’s a video for the show: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ri7u7ugzZbU

Abbey Road bio: 
With their tight harmonies, flawless note for note renditions of Beatles hits, custom–tailored costumes, vintage instruments, Liverpudlian dialect and precise attention to every detail, Abbey Road has honed their show to become one of the most musically and visually satisfying Beatle tribute acts in the world. 
 
Abbey Road also performs in two nationally touring shows, “Beatles vs. Stones – A Musical Showdown” and “In My Life – A Musical Theatre Tribute to the Beatles.”
 
“The show delivers!” said the L.A. Times. “If you see one tribute show, see this one – smart and loads of fun,” said the O.C. Register. “This is the ticket for you,” said the Idaho Statesman.

A multi-instrumentalist, singer-songwriter and live finalist from season one of NBC's ""The Voice"", this DFW native is bringing his annual Christmas show home for the first time. The son of two Broadway performers, Patrick's first foray into country music was on the Arlington Music Hall stage with Johnny High's Country Music Revue. Thomas was a regular at the AMH throughout his childhood before moving to Nashville at 18 to pursue a music career and attend Vanderbilt University. 
A genre-bending artist, Thomas spent the decade following his appearance on ""The Voice"" writing songs with Nashville's best, penning hundreds as a signed songwriter in Music City. Exploring a variety of styles from musical theatre, (he composed a musical entitled ""The Battle of Franklin"" that would break box office records for the premiering theatre), to pop, R&B, and country, he eventually began work on his 2017 debut album with Grammy Award winner Mark Bright.  Meanwhile, Thomas was busy touring the country with Broadway vocalist Rachel Potter, co-starring in ""Country Legends"", a concert-style musical revue of country music through the ages designed specifically for symphony orchestras. The show toured for over five years, appearing with orchestras from Alaska to Hawaii and everywhere in between. 
Thomas, often recognized for his ability to adapt and improvise regardless of genre, returned to the national spotlight when Nashville hosted the 2019 NFL Draft. As each player was selected, he wrote and performed thirty-second “jingles”, live for CBS, each tailored to the specific athlete and team.  
Thomas is continuing to write, record, and release new music while awaiting his debut as Paul Simon in the US/Canada tour of “The Simon and Garfunkel Story” after extensive, pandemic-induced delays.

Suddenly, a gang of homeless fairy-tale characters (Pinocchio, Cinderella, the Three Pigs, you name it) raid his sanctuary, saying they’ve been evicted by the vertically challenged Lord Farquaad. So Shrek strikes a deal: I’ll get your homes back, if you give me my home back! But when Shrek and Farquaad meet, the Lord strikes a deal of his own: He’ll give the fairy-tale characters their homes back, if Shrek rescues Princess Fiona. Shrek obliges, yet finds something appealing–something strange and different–about this pretty princess. He likes her. A lot. But why does she always run off when the sun sets?

Suddenly, a gang of homeless fairy-tale characters (Pinocchio, Cinderella, the Three Pigs, you name it) raid his sanctuary, saying they’ve been evicted by the vertically challenged Lord Farquaad. So Shrek strikes a deal: I’ll get your homes back, if you give me my home back! But when Shrek and Farquaad meet, the Lord strikes a deal of his own: He’ll give the fairy-tale characters their homes back, if Shrek rescues Princess Fiona. Shrek obliges, yet finds something appealing–something strange and different–about this pretty princess. He likes her. A lot. But why does she always run off when the sun sets?

Exploring the possibilities of progressive, classical and world influences, yet rooted with the soul of the blues and R&B, Joseph Puerta, Christopher North, David Pack and Burleigh Drummond created a new sound that was defined and recognized as “Ambrosia”.
Originally labeled as America’s answer to the progressive invasion of such English acts as “Yes” and “King Crimson”, the group quickly proved it was all that and much more as it’s albums painted aural landscapes covering the gamut of musical styles and attracting the collaboration of such cultural icons as, Leonard Bernstein, Kurt Vonnegut Jr. and Alan Parsons.
In it’s brief recording history, Ambrosia garnered 5 Grammy Nominations, 5 Hit Singles, Heavy FM Airplay and the admiration and respect of the musical community.  All this was in addition to Sold Out concerts around the world.
Today, the band is more alive and compelling than ever.  With three of the original members in tact plus the addition of guitar ace Doug Jackson on electric guitar and backing vocals, Mary Harris contributing amazing keyboards and vocals, with the fantastic power vocals of Kipp Lennon (Venice)…Ambrosia is exploring new musical territory and continuing to wow life-long fans and new converts alike!

John Ford Coley is an American singer, guitarist, classically trained pianist, actor, and author. He is most revered as half of the Grammy nominated duo, England Dan and John Ford Coley.
Born in Dallas, Texas, John grew up listening to the Grand Ole Opry and early rock and roll music. He also grew up singing church hymns and learning to play classical piano. When he was just 16 years old, he and schoolmate Dan Seals, joined the group Theze Few. Later, the band became Southwest F.O.B. and toured the Texas music scene. They had one hit in 1969, “The Smell of Incense”, which hit number 43 on the charts – and soon the band got to play on stage with Led Zeppelin and other acts.

SHAYNE HILL
Shayne Hill is the not-so-new “new guy.” Shayne joined the band in June of 2004—after rehearsing with the band once. Once. Yes—he was that good.
Shayne grew up on the road playing music. His family had a band and they toured all across the Western U.S.—with Shayne playing even more instruments than he does today. But no—he will not play fiddle for you. We’ve already asked him.
Once moving to Nashville, Shayne toured with Chely Wright, Avalon, and LeAnn Rimes, just to name a few. He is also an in-demand background singer and guitar player. And since he needs just a little bit more to do, he has his own recording studio—where he can be found whenever one of his kids isn’t crying…and sometimes even when they are.
Shayne and his wife Kristin have two children, Jesse and Harper—they are cute like their mama.
JOE SMYTH
Joe Smyth never met a percussive instrument he didn’t like—and he can play them all. The band’s original bio stated that Joe played 300 percussive instruments—a number that Hobie made up, but still swears by.
Joe is a graduate of the Berklee College of Music and earned a Master’s Degree in Music from the University of Miami—but he doesn’t rub that in the other guys’ faces. That speaks volumes about him.
In addition to being a sought-after session drummer, Joe is accomplished symphonic musician, as well. He has played with the Nashville Symphony, including at their heralded appearance at Carnegie Hall.
Joe is also a respected percussion instructor, doing his part to nurture the next generation of drummers and percussionists.
Joe is the proud dad of Tristan, Jenna, and Bryce.
GREGG HUBBARD
Gregg “Hobie” Hubbard was born and raised in Apopka, Florida—The Indoor Foliage Capitol of the World. So there.
There was never a time Hobie can remember that he wasn’t listening to—and by listening we mean obsessed with—music. He grew up attached to the radio and record player—and is still rarely very far from either one today…although the record player looks more like an ipod these days.
Hobie sang and played piano in church through his high school years and began writing songs when he was in college. He has co-written several of Sawyer Brown’s hits, including “The Dirt Road,” “Drive Me Wild,” “’Round Here,” and “Outskirts of Town,” as well as several songs on the Sawyer Brown Christmas albums. In addition to Sawyer Brown, Hobie has sung background on recording sessions for a variety of artists.
Hobie gave up a promising career in the food services industry to join the band. He might or might not still have the smock.
MARK MILLER
Mark Miller was born in Ohio, but moved to Florida when he was in eighth grade. Growing up, he played basketball, went to the beach, worked at Walt Disney World, and went to school—pretty much in that order. He was on the basketball team at the University of Central Florida when he started writing songs, finally deciding to move to Nashville to focus on singing and songwriting. The move worked out okay.
Mark has written many of Sawyer Brown’s hits, including “Step That Step,” “The Walk,” “Thank God for You,” “The Boys and Me,” as well as the band’s anthem: “Some Girls Do.”
Mark discovered the band Casting Crowns and has produced all of the band’s CDs, winning a Grammy for his work with them along the way. In April 2013, “Ring the Bell,” a movie that Mark wrote and produced, was released—and he has more movies in the pre-production stage. He doesn’t sleep much. Mark and his wife Lisa have two children—Madison and Gunnar. They own their daddy.

The desire to be onstage started early. He began acting at the age of 6 and by the 
age of 20 he was traveling all over the world - from Africa to Southeast Asia, from 
Russia to Central America - using his communication skills to influence 
international leaders with humor and inspiration. Eventually Prather's 
communication skills opened doors for him to move into the corporate arena of 
motivational speaking and writing.
Prather is known for his way with words. He is a comedian, armchair philosopher, 
musician, and observational humorist. He is often referred to as ""the modern day 
Will Rogers."" He is a fast-talking combination of Lewis Grizzard and Jeff 
Foxworthy. Originally from Augusta, GA Chad now calls the Fort Worth, TX area 
home. He grew up working with horses (an industry he is actively involved in) and 
is often recognized by his ever-present cowboy hat. His social media viral video 
are counted in the hundreds of millions. Many recognize him from his fast talking, 
rapid fire rants from the front seat of his truck. CNN has labeled him the ""Pick-up 
Pundit"" and Fox News' Tucker Carlson has called Prather, ""supernaturally 
articulate."" He is known for his comedic family stories told from an adult 
perspective onstage. 
Prather has made numerous appearances on Fox News, CNN, A&E, The Blaze, 
MSN and has been featured in magazines from Southern Living to Nash Country 
Weekly. He is the host of Ride TV's ""It's My Backyard"" and ""Chad Prather's 
Comedy Shootout."" His wildly successful 2016 ""Kings of Cowtown Comedy Tour"" 
was a hit and his current ""Star Spangled Banter Comedy Tour"" is selling out 
theaters all over America. He is one of the country's fastest rising and talked about 
comedians and entertainers.
